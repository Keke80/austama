Kennedy, just 19, received the second Pfizer Vaccine and soon after began
experiencing severe chest pain, pressure, and shortness of breath. She was
hospitalised with myocarditis; inflammation of the heart wall. The team said she
was the second young adult they knew of this happening to in the local area.

Kennedy is home now and will continue to be on heart medication for three to six
months under the care of a cardiologist. It’s unknown whether or not there will
be permanent damage to her heart.

Kennedy’s mother Krista says:

“We had no knowledge this was a possibility, which makes me even angrier this
has happened to my child. There’s a lot of pressure on this vaccine right now,
especially with many Colleges saying you must have this to attend classes. You
try to do the right things for your family and community, but as a result our
daughter may now have permanent heart issues. I only ask you to read this with
an open mind and to learn from our experience.”
