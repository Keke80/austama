My symptoms from the Pfizer Vaccine Jabs: First 18th January Lot EL0739, Second
12th April Lot EM4965

Electrify racing whizzing feeling head to toe Blood rushing to brain Electricity
sensation across forehead Feeling hot, then feeling cold Gurgling within my
body, moving up to my head Spinning sensation in body Feeling like something
running throughout me and attacking my heart The sensations from stomach to
brain are getting worse

I’m 31 from Hereford England. Doctors have run CT scans on my stomach and
chest. I paid privately for a MRI on my brain and two ultrasounds on
stomach. They have refused to let me see a gastro specialist. I’ve had lots of
bloods taken and and been given an ECG. No diagnosis so far!
