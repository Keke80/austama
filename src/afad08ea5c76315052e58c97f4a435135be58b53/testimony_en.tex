Aged only 57 Years, John died 12 days after the receiving the J\&J Vaccine. He
was admitted to hospital due to extreme shortness of breath and doctors
diagnosed him with a pulmonary embolism (blood clots in his lungs).

He was placed on a ventilator and in a medically-induced coma the next day as
his condition rapidly deteriorated doctors then discovered that John had a
stroke that damaged the entire left side of his brain.

The doctor told Rachel Weise, his daughter, that it was the worst stroke he’d
seen in his career.

The doctors filled out 2 separate VEARS reports, one for pulmonary embolism and
the other for the stroke – noting the severity of the stroke.

He was brain dead and taken off life support and passed away on 22nd April.
