Elliot’s Story in his own words:

Hello my name is Eliott and I’m 24 years old, in perfect health, yet I had a
pretty serious heart attack only 5 days after the second injection of the Pfizer
vaccine.

I spent more than a week in intensive care at the Salpêttrière in Paris, France
where I’m still, I also went not far of death.

24 years is very, very young for a heart attack. I specify that I never used
drugs etc… I was sporty because I wanted to become a pilot in the army, for
those who know, I had passed a very advanced class 1 medical at the Toulon CEMPN
that detected absolutely nothing abnormal 6 months earlier. I had been declared
fit for fighter pilot training, now this heart attack has flown all my dreams
for which ones I fought.

The doctors haven’t actually found the cause and don’t know what to say when I
talk about the vaccine but admit it can be a cause, yet it seems more and more
obvious to me.

I’m going to have to take life meds and my heart may not recover at 100\%, I’m
only 24 years old, I was military, I’m devastated, my life is wasted. A month
ago everything was fine.
