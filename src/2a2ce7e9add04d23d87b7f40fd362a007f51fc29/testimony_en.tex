Courtney explains in her own words:

I received the AstraZenaca Vaccine during late April 2021 whilst I was staying
at the YMCA in Colchester Essex UK.

The reaction shown in the photo developed on my legs, arms and back. I later
found out that I should never have been administered the AstraZeneca Vaccine
because it shouldn't have been given to anyone under the age of 30 in the UK.

My veins and blood cells had burst and were bleeding under the skin. I was
unable to walk for a over a month where it had attacked the nerves and joints in
my legs.

I was in a wheelchair during this lengthy period and was then having to learn to
start walking again with a walker.

I was in hospital Colchester General Hospital for over a month, although they
ignored me and sent me home numerous times and left to suffer without any
treatment. I was later told that if I didn’t go to hospital when I did, it could
have been fatal.

Having this vaccine is one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made. Nearly two
months later and I'm still not able to walk properly, and not able to fully do
the normal activities I used to - and the rash has still not fully gone yet.

I am just spreading awareness because I would never want anybody to go through
what I've had to endure.
