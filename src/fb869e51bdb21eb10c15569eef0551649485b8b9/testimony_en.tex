Yusuke, a Japanese Professional Baseball Player and a Pitcher for the Chunichi
Dragons, collapsed 8 days after the Covid-19 Vaccine He was hospitalized after
collapsing during practice on July 6th and was put on a ventilator until his
death on August 3rd 2021.

Japanese media reported widely on his shocking death. News website ‘Sponichi’
initially included the headline: “Was vaccinated against Corona”…. but this was
quickly changed!

However, Yahoo Japan did report that the sudden collapse of the baseball player
might have been connected to his recent Covid-19 Vaccination.

Uichiro Oshima, the owner of the Chunichi Dragons, said in a recent interview:

“I’ve heard that he became sick after vaccination. He is hospitalized and
fighting for his life. I don’t know the causal relationship between his
vaccination and collapse.”
