Ashleigh Wilson (Rory’s fiancée) telling his story to Chantelle Baker.

Rory was a fit and healthy 26 year old who died 12 days after receiving the
Pfizer Vaccine. Rory received the Pfizer Vaccine on November 5th 2021 and
started feeling ‘heart flutters’ that evening. The symptoms continued and he
started to suffer heart palpitations and an ‘uncomfortable’ feeling in his
chest.

News reports state that he had heart palpitations for several days before
collapsing to the floor of his home on November 17th. His fiancée Ashleigh
Wilson recently went public to speak about the ordeal.

“I watched him die and I could not get to him. We were about to leave for the
hospital and he was in the toilet and I heard a thud. He had fallen, his body
was blocking the door, his full weight was against it and I couldn’t get it
open. I could just see him through a crack in the door, I could see that he was
gone.”

“We originally put the symptoms down to stress, but finally decided to head to
the hospital at 3 am for reassurance, but within moments Rory went into cardiac
arrest and died instantly in our home.”

Rory’s death is now being investigated by the coroner and health officials to
find out whether it is connected to the Pfizer Jab he received 12 days
earlier. However, Ashleigh is certain that his death was due to the Vaccine.

“So, a few days after his passing, I looked at his phone and I saw some Google
searches. They were like ‘myocarditis’ and ‘heart racing after the vaccine’, and
there was about ten of them. They were all searched about an hour before he
passed away. So, I think that night he was starting to panic and he thought that
it was from the vaccine. And in his mind, he started experiencing those
symptoms, obviously after he had his vaccine. So that’s really helped me make my
mind up that I definitely 110\% know that it was the vaccination.”
