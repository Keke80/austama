Julie Anne’s Story in Her Own Words:

I want to bring awareness to side effects that can happen once you get your Covid shot. I am not here to tell anyone to get or not to get the shot I just want to share my experience so people can have more evidence of things that are possible to happen coming from someone they know.

I happily went to my CVS in my target to get my shot. Excited for the new lift of mask mandates in you are fully vaccinated and have been hearing on the news how it is safe, everyone over the age of 16 should go get it,So I did.

Within 45 mins I was in the emergency room unable to swallow. weird, but not a huge deal. Received some steroids and Benadryl and was sent home.

3 days later I have what felt like panic attack twice in two hours with crazy neck pain and face numbness. After just going to the emergency room, I truly did not want to go back to pay another huge bill.

But this morning I woke up unable to move the right side of my face. Went to urgent care where they rushed me out and sent me to the emergency room and ran CT, MRI, EKG and blood work to rule out a stroke. I was diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy.

Since finding that out I have googled and searched more information about Bell’s Palsy with covid shot. I am reporting my reaction however I can just so it can be documented as possibly being more common than they say.

Julie Ann has started to have extensive Neurological Involvement, Stroke Like Episodes, Convulsions and is under a Neurologist.
