My father Tim Clarke received hIs first vaccine shot from Pfizer in March of
this year. Two weeks later he had lost 18 pounds and had severe paralysis of his
back and extremities. We took him to his family doctor and she ran every test
she could and said his blood count was off and sent him home waiting for an MRI.

Two weeks had passed and my Dadâ€™s symptoms were worsening and he started to get
chest pains, so my mum called the ambulance .

He was at the Henderson for 7 days then released. They could not find anything
wrong with my dad. They just sent him home and told to continue 3 more days of
penicillin. They said he had a blood infection, but he died two weeks later of a
massive cardiac embolism blood clot.

My dad was a fit 77 year old man before this Pfizer Vaccine. He suffered so much
in the the last 2 months of his life due to this shot and died as a
result. Please think before you do this people.

The above picture was taken before his death whilst in release from the
hospital.
