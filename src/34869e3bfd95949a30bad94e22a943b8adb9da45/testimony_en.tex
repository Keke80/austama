After weeks of hospitalization, Ashley, aged just 34, was diagnosed with
Myopericarditis and had suffered a Heart Attack due to the Johnson \& Johnson
Vaccine. Myocarditis and Pericarditis is inflammation of the heart or its
surrounding sack.

Ashley relays some parts of her story:

Three Months later, I’m here, 6th Floor-Cardiac Unit. Sleeping with IVs in both
arms, 24 Hour Heart Monitor, Daily EKGs, Chest X-rays, 2x Daily Blood-work,
Echocardiogram, Cardiac CT, Cardiac Cath Procedure, \& lastly the Cardiac MRI to
show the inflammation and scarring of my heart….. indicating a Heart Attack and
a Coronary Artery Tear! And now I have an incision in my groin that’s super
uncomfortable!

They’ve figured out a decent cocktail of medications which has helped –
especially when your Troponin levels reach 7.30!! (0.4 – 0.39).

I’m home now but I can’t lift over 10lbs, I’m on 6 different new
medications. Still have random weird heart palpitations throughout the day and
night.

Cardiologist says it may take 6-8 months for this coronary artery tear to
heal. However the Myocarditis can come back any day/month/year unexpectedly.

I was instructed by two Cardiologist’s and an Infectious Disease Doctor to NEVER
receive another COVID Vaccine again!!
