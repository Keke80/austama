Died of Vaccine-Induced Thrombosis and Thrombocytopenia (VITT).

Stephen had complained of a pins and needles sensation in his arm. To both his
and Charlottes disbelief, Stephen’s arm began moving on its own. Bewildered and
confused, the couple did not delay in calling an ambulance as Stephen was
showing worrying signs of a possible stroke. On the paramedics arrival Stephen’s
blood pressure was alarmingly high so he was taken to hospital for further
checks and scans.

Multiple scans revealed that there was significant bleeding on his brain,
concluding he had suffered a very rare cerebral venous stroke. Stephen’s
condition further deteriorated resulting in him seizuring during his scans at
King’s College Hospital.

Sadly, Stephen’s death was later confirmed that day on 26th January. However,
even after his passing, Stephen continued to do good as his wish to donate his
organs was granted. Put on life support for a few days until donors were found.

Stephen was a mental health specialist and he was immanently due to start a new
position as a senior clinical psychologist at Great Ormond Street
Hospital. However, Stephen’s future was devastatingly taken from him.

He leaves his wife Charlotte and two young sons Izaac and Elijah.
