Arianna lost her life due to a Heart Attack in less than 24 hours, the day after
the second dose of the Pfizer Vaccine.

She died on 1st October in the emergency room of the “Vito Fazzi” of Lecce,
Italy.

Arianna, a high school student, got her shot on September 30th. She fell ill
shortly after and was rushed to hospital where she died hours later. Lecce’s
Public Prosecutor Office is expected to open an investigation into her sudden
death.

Arianna, was a first-year student at ‘Banzi’ scientific high school, got her
second shot on the morning of Thursday. She returned home but fell ill that
night around 04:00. She was then rushed to the emergency room of Vito Fazzi
Hospital where, despite the best efforts of doctors to save her, she died.

The tragic news began to circulate in Trepuzzi on Friday morning, throwing the
entire community into despair. Mayor Guiseppi Taurino said: “Everyone feels pain
when a community loses a young life. There are no words to describe the pain of
the parents who have to bury their child. The country must gather around the
victim’s family and make their solidarity and affection felt, as well as towards
the girl’s schoolmates and friends, among whom there is great pain because of
this sudden death.”

An autopsy will be performed by Dr. Giovanni Serio, head of Vito Fazzi Hospital,
and coroner Alberto Tortorella to clarify whether there is a correlation between
the administration of the second Pfizer vaccine and her sudden cardiac arrest
less than 24 hours later.

The funeral of Arianna was initially scheduled for 2nd October but was then
postponed to allow the autopsy to take place.

This follows the sudden death of Sofia Benhairira of Italy, featured on NMS
here.

The tragedy comes just two weeks after the death of 14-year-old Majda El Razak
who entered into a coma two days after receiving her second Pfizer COVID-19
vaccine and then died 26 days later. This case is being investigated for
manslaughter.
