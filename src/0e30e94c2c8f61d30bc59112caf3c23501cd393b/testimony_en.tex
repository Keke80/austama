Majda went into a coma which began just two days after receiving the second dose
of Pfizer Vaccine and sadly died 26 days later. Majda, who lived in italy and
was of Moroccan origin, received the first dose of the vaccine Pfizer on July
22nd, then the second jab on August 17th.

The following day, August 18, she experienced severe headache and swelling in
one eye that made it necessary to be hospitalised on August 19th. A few hours
later the clinical picture worsened and she slipped in to a coma, which lasted
26 days at the Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Tricase, Italy.

It will be down to the autopsy to clarify whether there are any correlations
between the death and the double administration of the vaccine. The parents,
assisted by the lawyer Pasquale Scorrano, asked the judiciary to ascertain
whether there is a possible link between the Pfizer Vaccine and the death of
their daughter. According to the doctors it was a rare form of meningitis!
