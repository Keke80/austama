Iâ€™m just 63 and live in Spain.

Since April13th I have had severe reactions to the AstraZeneca vaccine. Only had
the 1st one. My symptoms are:

Excruciating pain front left hand side of head, Numb face same side, Deafness
same side, Dizziness, Blurred vision, Itchy skin, Pins and needles in hands and
feet, Heart Palpitations, Lethargy, Brain Fog, Memory Problems and Suicidal
Thoughts, Generally feeling Unwell, Loss of appetite

My Symptoms are so bad I am frightened to go to sleep as this is all very
scary. I am an an asthmatic and have epilepsy, although both are well managed.

Before the Vaccine I was leading a normal active life and I got the Vaccine
becasue I was told it would make me safe from Covid. I trusted what I was told
by the Government and now I am left with horrific symptoms and am devastated by
what has happened!
