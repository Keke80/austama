Wayne’s Video and story in his own words:

I got Brain Tissue Damage as a direct result of my covid vaccine. It took me two weeks to be taken seriously by my doctors and by the time a GP finally told me to go for an examination – I was dizzy, had crashing headaches, mentally confused, slurring my words, and had trouble walking.

On immediate examination by my doctor he called me an ambulance and was in agreement with a paramedic for me to exaggerate my condition to get seen more in-depth but when they took my blood pressure it was 203/120 and I was then told not to worry as that was serious enough. Bearing in mind I was already in a seriously bad way, as the doctor said to me on arrival.

I was admitted to hospital for 11 days where I had CT Scans, MRI’s, Deep Opthalmic scans of my eyes and a lumber puncture of which the last 2 weren’t needed they told me as clear evidence of the brain tissue damage was seen on the MRI’s which I have actually seen myself in a more recent Neurological appt.

On two separate occasions consultants have told me that they see as likely in my future a prognosis of MS and/or Dementia.

Since discharge from hospital my meds have been continually altered to counteract the ever increasing fluctuations in bp and headaches to that I’m now taking five separate bp meds which makes a total of 10 which includes pain relief and migraine medications.

A more recent MRI was called for to further investigate a possible progression of the damage due to the drastically increased meds over the last few months which I also fear is occurring. I’m awaiting results of these as to hopeful next steps.
