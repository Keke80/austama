Ludovic Clerc had just begun a new job at Hopital Psychiatrique de Montpellier
(Montpellier Psychiatric Hospital).

Ludo’s Story Told by his Father Jean Francois:

My son received his second Moderna injection on Thursday, July 22nd at around
5pm. The next morning he informed me of pain in the arm where the injection had
been done.

The next day Saturday 24th around 12noon we he tried to wake him and my son
wasn’t moving and blood had spilled from his nostrils! Despite the response of
the firemen I urgently contacted, they could only see his death.

I lost a huge part of myself this terrible day in July and will hold a great
place in my heart for this beloved son.  For my grandson Melvin (Ludo’s Son) who
is only 13 years old, I feel so sad, yet I have to keep living in honour my
Ludo.

Rest in peace my baby.
