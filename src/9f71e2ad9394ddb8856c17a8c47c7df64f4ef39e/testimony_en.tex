I thought I was doing the “right thing” and went and got the Pfizer Vaccine.

The past four weeks have felt like a nightmare that I can’t wake up from. I was
a perfectly healthy 21 year old female who had no underlying health conditions.

Since getting the vaccine I have been in and out of hospital, doctors,
cardiologist appointments and have had every test under the sun repeated at
least twice, and still no answers. I can not get up off my bed, I struggle to
sit up in a chair. My body is tachycardic all the time and I’m in constant pain.

The doctors have put me on beta blockers to reduce the symptoms however they
make me feel dizzy, lightheaded and just generally unwell. I have permanent
damage to my body that is going to affect me for the rest of my life from a
Vaccine I was forced to get!

I am receiving no income at the moment as I am physically and mentally not able
to work and have not been provided with any further assistance. Someone needs to
stand up and take responsibility for these side effects. There are so many
people suffering similar adverse reactions and nothing is being done.

This vaccine has physically, mentally, and emotionally destroyed not only my
health but my whole life. I understand why so many people have gotten vaccinated
as I was one of those who thought they were doing the right thing.

The government needs to acknowledge that there are severe and quite common
adverse reactions and they aren’t being spoken about enough!
