Diane's Story Told by her Brother Billy: On April 19th of 2021, two days after
receiving her 2nd Pfizer vaccine, my sister Diane suffered a hemorrhagic stroke,
caused by the rupturing of an artery in her brain. The damage suffered has led
to tragic complications, including greatly compromised mental abilities, and the
loss of use on her left side.

Due to the swelling in her brain, her doctors were compelled to perform a
craniotomy, removing part of her skull to relieve pressure. On August 19th,
Diane will have a shunt installed, which entails drilling a hole in the back of
her head to insert a tube that should help drain the fluid off her brain.

Depending on how well she adapts to that procedure, the doctors hope to
eventually reattach the bone plate to her skull. To Date Diane is unable and
incapable of moving home and is presently in a long term care facility.

Her next surgery is on the 19th of August. She will go in at 5am and will be
there for a couple of days. We are hopeful that her recovery will will start
soon after that. Diane has always had long beautiful hair until this happened to
her but she is proud of her new punk hair do
