Roy, a football player and former defender for the Waterford Football Club
passed away 3 days after the J \& J Janssen Vaccine.

Roy Butler received the experimental Johnson \& Johnson (Janssen) viral vector
DNA injection on Friday, 13th August 2021, according to his aunt, Marian
Harte. He suffered severe headaches and general malaise within one hour. By
Saturday 14th August, he was vomiting and having convulsions. He was placed in a
medically-induced coma on Monday, 16th August, but sadly he died on 17th August.

It appears he had a hemorrhagic stroke and/or ruptured brain aneurysm within a
day or two according to his aunt and another woman named Vera McDonald.

Ms. McDonald said Roy ``went downhill quick'' following the injection. Ms. Harte
wrote that Roy was ``fighting for his life'' at 2:11 a.m. local time Tuesday,
August 17. About 18 hours later, Ms. Harte tweeted that Roy ``lost his battle,
heâ€™s (sic) gone to God.''

Irish media completely covered-up the fact that the Covid-19 Vaccine was the
cause of his death, with none of them mentioning that it was Johnson \&
Johnson. Ms. Harte called out a local reporter named Darren Skelton for failing
to report truthfully about her nephew.
