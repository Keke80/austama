Sara had a haemorrhage stroke in her brain stem on Sunday Feb 7th, at the young
age of 28 Years Old, just 5 days after the Pfizer Vaccine. She was put on life
support.

After all of the tests run, and the MRI results, Doctors told the family it was
most likely a Brain Aneurism, and she was born with it!!!

They stated that there was no possibility of recovery and eventually her body
will eventually shut down.

On 18th February at 5:36 pm Sara took her last breath. She had a massive stroke
in her brainstem.

She loved spending time with her friends and family and her son, Zachary John
Gowman Jr. “BZ”
