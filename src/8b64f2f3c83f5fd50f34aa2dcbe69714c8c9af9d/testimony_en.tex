Joel Isherwood – in his own words:

“A few weeks ago I had my second AstraZeneca vaccine and the following day woke
up with a sudden loss of hearing in one of my ears, and was referred to the
hospital.

After numerous tests, I was told yesterday that the Vaccine has attacked an ear
infection I had, damaging the nerves behind my eardrum.

There is no further treatment they can offer me. I’m permanently deaf in my
right ear and have a constant ringing which I have to ‘learn to live with.’

I didn’t know any of the risks before going to get my jab and, had I known, I
certainly wouldn’t have had it! These vaccines are still being trialed and there
is limited knowledge of side effects, so make sure it’s right for you and don’t
just follow the crowd!”
