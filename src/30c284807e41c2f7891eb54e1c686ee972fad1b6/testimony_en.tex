On the 29th June 2021 Georgia from the United Kingdom had her second Pfizer
Jab. From then, she didn’t quite realise what was in store for her and her
family.

On Getting the first jab, she just had a headache and severe tiredness. However,
she had immediate side effects after the second jab, and started suffering
headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness and daily fainting episodes. Literally
fainting at the drop of a hat, leaving her boyfriend to scoop her up.

Fast forward approximately 10 days later and the tremors started, fully body
tremors. She then slowly declined losing the ability to walk properly.

On Wednesday 14th July 2021 she was admitted to hospital, and a week later she’s
still there and awaiting numerous promised results following MRI’s, CT, Lumbar
Punctures and Blood Tests.

Her frustration is ‘through the roof’, along with the stress her family and
friends are going through. They all just want to know definitively what is going
on.

Assuming the tests are ALL clear it is being diagnosed as FND. But they are
still waiting.

She was reluctant to get the jabs from the start, but after overwhelming
pressure from her peers and the media to do so, she caved.

She says “DO NOT feel pressured into getting this vaccine, please. I didn’t want
it done. I felt pressured by peers and media”
