Adamâ€™s Wife Telling Us His Story:

My late husband Adam was born 3rd May 1983, he was fit and healthy with no
underlining health issues.

He had the Moderna Vaccine on the 23rd May 2021 and had suffered a heart attack
due to a blood clot on the 15th June 2021. He was hospitalised for nearly 2
weeks in intensive care and, although the doctors have confirmed his arteries
were in pristine condition, he sadly passed away on the 27th June 2021.

No postmortem was done, no support in this investigation by the hospitals and no
one has even considered that it may be down to the Vaccine!

Adam is Forever in our hearts.
