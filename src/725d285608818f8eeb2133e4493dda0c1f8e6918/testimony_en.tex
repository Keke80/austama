Very soon after the Vaccine Jane started to show symptoms. She was very pale and
white and very tired. She went to the hospital and they noticed she had a very
low blood count and had to have a transfusion. Four days later she lost
consciousness whilst she was in the hospital and she then had trouble breathing.

She then had to be intubated as she could not breath and was totally unconscious.

She was losing blood so fast that she had eight blood transfusions.

The doctors were pumping her full of antibiotics as the lungs were filling up
with blood and they were sucking blood out of her lungs continually.

She was deaf from a genetic disorder and occasionally when she woke as she was
so sedated she could not speak due to being intubated.

Her lungs continually filling with blood, she was drowning in her own blood and
it was horrific.

Sadly, Jane died four days later.
