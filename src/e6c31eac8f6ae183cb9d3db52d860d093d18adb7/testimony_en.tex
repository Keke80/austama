Hours after attending his college graduation, Isaiah Harris was rushed to the
emergency room after complaining of being unable to breathe. Once at the
hospital, Harris suffered a heart attack while waiting for treatment.

The first hospital he visited after suffering an adverse reaction to Pfizer’s
COVID refused to believe his symptoms were a result of the COVID shot. Isaiah
was diagnosed with inflammation of the heart, or myocarditis.

After being hospitalised for four days in Rogers, Arkansas, Harris was released
and sent home with medication to numb his heart and reduce the swelling. But
when he tried to phone the doctor to say he was still suffering from heart pain,
the nurses stonewalled him, he said.

“One of the nurses who treated me picked up,” said Harris. “Some words were
exchanged and she ended up hanging up on me and wouldn’t get me through to the
doctor.”

About a month and a half later, Isaiah went to see Dr. Allen Kline at the
Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, after being referred by a friend. Kline is aware of
the link between mRNA COVID vaccines and myocarditis. He’s witnessed hundreds of
cases, said Harris.

Isaiah said he felt pressured to get the vaccine. He said he thought it was
safe, that there weren’t any risks. “I plan on going to medical school and
thought it was a requirement,” said Harris. “There’s a lot of pressure to get it
right now.”

While Isaiah hasn’t fully recovered, he said he’s doing a lot better. However,
he’s been advised to keep his activity levels low for the next six months, and
can do little more than walk his dog.
