My 39-year-old daughter, Charlene, has had an unfortunate adverse reaction to
the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine.

Charlene had her second COVID 19 vaccine on June 11th and then, on June 13th,
was rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night. She was experiencing
shortness of breath, heart pain, blue tinge to her finger tips and lips,
completely lethargic and a fever of 105.

She was quickly diagnosed with Myocarditis and Pericarditis, including a small
hole in her heart. This is a rare occurrence that has been found in some people
as a ‘complication’ of the vaccine. Charlene had a previous under-lying heart
condition, born with a heart murmur.

She has been under the care of her family physician, cardiologists and internal
medicine team. The team is working hard at having an understanding of the issues
and doing their best to help her recover.

The doctors have advised her to remain off work, however, at this time there is
no conversation as to when she will be able to return as she is now going into
her fifth month of being off. It is sad that someone, as in my daughter, who is
still willing to be working during the pandemic, is unable to work due to an
adverse reaction of the Pfizer Vaccine.

She always has a very positive outlook on life, and it breaks my heart watching
her struggle through this time. She is a single mom of two teenagers, who she
adores deeply, and her kids have been impacted throughout this scare.
