Miriam, a pharmacist, had been vaccinated on January 14th. The next day she went
to the pharmacy to work and felt ill. Her situation immediately appeared very
serious.

She was then urgently transported by ambulance to the Bufalini hospital in
Cesena, Italy where she sadly died of a stroke few days later, on Wednesday 20th
January.

“She was the nicest woman in the world, beloved and full of life” – says Barbara
Pesci, Director of Ravenna Farmacie “It was totally unexpected. I had seen her a
few hours before she was sick, and she was cheerful as always”. In Porto Corsini
the whole Pro loco Council pays condolences to the family: “She was a beautiful
person, always sunny, always attentive”, says the president Orio Rossi.

She was a mother of 4 children.
