The Slovenian Government suspends Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine after the death of
Katja Jagodic, a 20 year old student.

Katja was vaccinated because it’s mandated for universities in Slovenia. She
received her shot on Thursday 16th September 2021. She suffered several health
problems shortly afterwards and was hospitalised on Monday 27th September at the
University Clinical Center (UKC) in Ljubljana. Her symptoms were so severe that
immediate medical attention was required. She died on 29th September in the
early morning.

Igor Rigler, head of the emergency neurology department at the University
Clinical Centre said, “she fell ill with a very serious condition. At the same
time, she had blood clots and low platelet counts, causing bleeding in her
brain. We have done everything that modern medicine can do in such
conditions. We consulted all the experts involved in this field at UKC –
vascular specialists, haematologists, nephrologists and neurologists. We
approached the treatment aggressively, but unfortunately we could not help her.”

Slovenian Minister of Health Janez Poklukar ordered the suspension of the
Janssen Covid-19 vaccine after the news.

The father of the deceased 20-year-old was present at a protest on 29th
September 2021 against the ‘COVID-Pass‘. The participants of the rally dedicated
a minute of silence before he said: “She wanted to have freedom, just like
everyone else here. On September 16th, she went to get vaccinated with Janssen
so that she wouldn’t be limited by nonsense. She is no more today. She was 20
years old.”

He continued, “when you get to the vaccination site, no one warns you of
possible complications. No one warns that vaccination with the Janssen Vaccine
is not recommended for people under 40. There are only numbers. There is only
talk of percentages. My Katja was not a percentage. She was my Katja,” the
emotional father said.

After the speeches, the crowd moved towards the Presidential Palace and
continued their journey through the streets of Ljubljana. The protesters, who
are against the mandatory COVID-Pass in order to work, access a gas station or a
shopping centre, eventually blocked a highway. Police were sent to the area with
water cannons to fight the protesters.
