Shawn was a Nursing Assistant and within 2 days she had Convulsions and Central
Nervous system involvement. Her symptoms still continue.

Shawn in her own words:

4th June 2021: As most of you know I took the Vaccine on 4th January 2021 and
since my life has forever changed! I have lost many friends, most of my
co-workers have abandoned me. My job terminated me!

Everything I loved to do I can no longer enjoy, my family is suffering! I miss
my job, my patients, that was my calling! It has all been taken from me and
American Senior Communities, Good Samaritan Home and Rehabilitative Center
dropped me like I was nothing! Workmans Comp denied me even though my DON told
me to go to the ER. It’s on my chart – I’m allergic to the Moderna Vaccine yet
can’t get a real diagnosis or any medical help!

26th June 2021: Please keep me in your prayers!! I have taken a few steps back
again this week. I lost use of my legs on Wednesday, I was able to get a walker
on Thursday to help me around but it’s definitely taking a physical and mental
toll! I’m trying to keep in mind the good days I have too but these bad ones are
really bad!

28 August 2021: Shawn still continues to suffer 8 months out from the vaccine,
“I was sitting on my bed talking with my husband and best friend, normal
conversation and within seconds things went south! They thought I was dead! It
took me so long coming out of this I thought I was going to die! Whatever
happened left me paralyzed from my waist down until this morning I was able to
use my legs again!
