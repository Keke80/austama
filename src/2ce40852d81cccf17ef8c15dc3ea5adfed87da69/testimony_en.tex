Alessandro, a law student, was found dead at home in Favignana, Italy. He was
Vaccinated just two days earlier with Pfizer.

His roommate had reported that he left Alessandro at home because he was ill and
wanted to stay in bed. It was in bed that the 118 Health Workers found him
lifeless. Two days before his death Alessandro had been given the first dose of
Pfizer Vaccine.

His friends said “Today is a very sad day for the Faculty of Law as yesterday,
our colleague Alessandro Campo, passed away following a Cardiac Arrest”

His sister Victoria Campo (23), a Palermo female football player in Italy, also
suddenly died of a Cardiac Arrest just two months after the premature death of
her brother Alessandro.
