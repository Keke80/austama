Apparently Myocarditis is a very rare reaction to the vaccine… yet there were
three of us in hospital with unexplained Myocarditis.

All having recently received the second Pfizer jab too.

I agree, I’m one of the unlucky ones, but at 36, does the risk of Covid outweigh
the risk of developing Myocarditis… certainly not in my case.

I had them because I wanted to go abroad and with all the pressure over vaccine
passports.

My bloods indicated high troponin levels and also irregularities on my ECG. I
was then sent for an Echo and Angiogram which confirmed the Myocarditis.

I had the jab around 8 weeks ago. Between then and now I had palpitations but
didn’t think anything of them. Thursday morning I woke up with bad chest pain
which was then pulsing down my arm.

Myself 36, Pawo 39 and Clive 41 have been diagnosed with Myocarditis, all in the
same ward, and none of us have any markers for infection.
