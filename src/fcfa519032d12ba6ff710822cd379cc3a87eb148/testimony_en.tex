On July 2nd 2021 my daughter Amanda Rich passed away from a blood clot which we
have every reason to believe was linked to the Covid-19 vaccine.

Amanda leaves behind her 19-month-old daughter “Allie Grace”. At the time of her
death Amanda was in the process of getting her Vet Tech License so she could
support herself and her daughter.

Amanda was a Certified Nursing Assistant for a home health care company in New
Ulm, Texas.

As most 23 year old young adults, she had made no plans to die, only to live and
give her daughter the best she possibly could.
