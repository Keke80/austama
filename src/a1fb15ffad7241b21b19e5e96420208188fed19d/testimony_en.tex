Zarife, only 23 years old, died 48 hours after receiving the Pfizer Vaccine.

She got her vaccine on September 13th. She was hospitalized on September 15th
but died shortly after as a result of intra-abdominal hemorrhage (abdominal
bleeding).

Haxhi Xhemajli, her grandfather said that his granddaughter got vaccinated at
the Vaccination Center in Drenas, on September 13th at 15:29. Zarife with no
underlying health issues passed away 48 hours later.

Haxhi wrote “You had to be vaccinated to stay in the workplace. That vaccine
caused your death after 48 hours. Do not force us, do not condition us. I will
find no peace until the truth is revealed. Someone will be held accountable I
swear. Rest in peace, our granddaughter,”

The prosecutor in Pristina has launched an investigation. The case is being
investigated as a suspicious death.
