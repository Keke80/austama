Died from Cerebral Haemorrhage followed by a heart attack.

Her son Raffaele Conte explains:

Following the AstraZeneca vaccine she started to have a fever. On the third day
she began to vomit relentlessly and on the evening of March 12th, we called the
ambulance which, after having checked her vital signs, refused to take her to
the hospital.

The following morning, or Saturday, March 13th, I asked my mother to move and
raise her left leg. She was convinced she could lift it but instead she was
totally still. I picked her up and took her to the emergency room of the
Ospedale del Mare where she was immediately admitted and they made a head CT
scan which revealed a cerebral haemorrhage.

Then we were told that he also had an occlusion of the aorta and two hours later
we were told that she had multiple district blood clots. At that point she was
put into a pharmacological coma.

On 13th March in the afternoon, the death of my 54-year-old Mother was
confirmed.
