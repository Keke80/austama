headache and nausea and was not urinating despite drinking fluids.

On February 3, 2021, she felt a little better but was still in bed all day.

On February 4, 2021, she woke up early. Her heart began racing so she asked her
stepfather to drive her to the local emergency room. They arrived at
around. 7:00 a.m. In the evening, she was flown to the Intermountain Medical
Center in Murray, Utah for a liver transplant. Her mother and stepfather
volunteered to donate a portion of their liver.

eyelashes on when her stepfather took her to the emergency room on February 5,
