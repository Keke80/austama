Following the Vaccine, on Tuesday 20th June after a lovely day with a walk,
lunch at a friend’s and a dip in the sea, I suddenly lost the vision in my left
eye, 28 hours after my Jab.

After about 32 hours in hospital, I now know this to be a central retinal artery
occlusion, considered a form of Transient Ischaemic Attack – in layman’s terms a
mini stroke caused by a blood clot behind my eye.

I am blind in my left eye and will be on medication for the rest of my life. I
was fit and healthy, could easily run 7-10 miles 3 times a week etc etc.

All being well I won’t have another episode, although, whilst there will always
be a risk, the only long term problem is my vision.

Raise awareness to take side effects seriously and report them!

You may think it could be just a coincidence, well I thought that too, but I
don’t fit into any ‘at risk category’ and they haven’t found a cause yet, BUT,
the UK ophthalmologist’s society since May have been urged to report cases such
as mine after having the Vaccine.

I urge people to reconsider how we make others feel should they choose not to
have the Vaccine. I am not against the vaccine but I am pro-choice.

My view for not wanting the Vaccine was judged time and time again, media and
the Government made my feel like I didn’t have a choice and for that I’m cross !

This photo is of my gorgeous daughter Abbie’s birthday. We had a great time and
on that day I popped in and had my 2nd Covid Vaccine.

I didn’t want the Vaccine after being skeptical, however I like to do the right
thing so with all the publicity and pressure, I went ahead.
