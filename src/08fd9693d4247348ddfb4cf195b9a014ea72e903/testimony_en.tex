I am 22 years old and always was a healthy young woman. I had my doubts about
this from the start, but never imagined my body would react to it this way. On
June 24 2021, I got my first Pfizer Vaccine. Besides some minor cardiovascular
complaints, I didn't feel much different. However I had a bad feeling about the
whole thing when I went to get my second shot on July 16th. Turns out my
intuition was right. Shortly after this second dose it all started, first
diarrhea and feeling very limp. Then burning sensations all over my skin and
full body muscle twitches.

I visited the emergency room as well as a neurologist; no one could help me. The
symptoms kept coming including sleeplessness, earworms (stuck song syndrome) so
loud that I couldn't properly follow conversations, tinnitus, dizziness and
extreme fatigue, shaking muscles in my arms and legs, skin rashes, panic attacks
and general muscle pain. I am still dealing with these symptoms daily,
my life has been flipped upside down completely.
