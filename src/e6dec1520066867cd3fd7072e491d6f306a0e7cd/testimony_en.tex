On April 28 I was vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. I wasn’t even
informed of which vaccine I was getting and thought I had gotten Pfizer, only to
find out later that they had given me AstraZeneca without verbal knowledge or
agreement.

After receiving the vaccine I have been injured for months, my eyes are in
severe pain, I can no longer wear makeup or ever feel good about myself because
of the severe burning pain in my eyes – and tongue and no one cares!

I am struggling and have gone into a severe depression since being vaccinated
because I cannot cope with the horrible pain in my eyes day in and day out. I am
going through a living nightmare that I never expected I’d have to go through.

I do hope everyone can understand how it feels to struggle with a Vaccine
Injury.
