Beth’s Story Told by her Daughter in Law Randi:

On April 9th 2021 around 3:30am, Beth was taken by ambulance to the hospital for
what we thought was a stroke, but CT and MRI confirmed it wasn’t. Beth was
diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) – a condition in which the immune
system attacks the nerves.

Beth was unable to get up, her body was weak and completely numb. When she
arrived to the hospital she could barely move, cough, or swallow so they put her
on a BIPAP machine until she needed to be fully intubated and medically sedated.

The doctors have linked her condition to the Covid Pfizer Vaccine that she
received ten days prior.

The prognosis to this syndrome is 6 months to 1 year. This is a very real and
scary syndrome!

She can as of now wiggle her toes and move her feet a tiny bit, she can also
move her hands and fingers, but by no means can she pickup her arms or legs or
the rest of her body.

We are told that her movement will all come back, but we’re taking it day by day
as that’s all we can do.

Due to the doctors Passy Muir speaking valve Tracheostomy she can now talk.

She is at a rehabilitation facility, has been taking baby streps, but making
HUGE milestones.
