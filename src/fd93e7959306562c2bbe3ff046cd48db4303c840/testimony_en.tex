Theresa is recovering from a severe autoimmune reaction to the Johnson \& Johnson
Covid-19 Vaccine.

She became unwell during Feb/March 2021 and, after receiving the 2nd Vaccine
she was hospitalized. She remained in the hospital from March through June due
to a diagnosis of Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) – a direct result of the Johnson
\& Johnson Vaccine.

During this time she also developed Atrial fibrillation, CHF, as well as
suffering multiple strokes. This along with GBS caused weakness and numbness in
her legs which resulted in her being confined to a wheelchair.

Unfortunately, at the end of her twelve week FMLA leave, her place of employment
let her go, with no financial support.
