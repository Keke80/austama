André tells his daughters story:

My 17 year old daughter Jasmine wasn’t so lucky with the 2nd injection on
September 22nd 2021.

Within 4 days she went from bad to worse having flu like symptoms, then losing
feelings in her legs.

It got worse to the point of being in a wheelchair and hospitalized.

She is now back home and slowly recovering.

Now exactly 1 month the pain has never stopped and she is on heavy painkiller
meds.

She has lost the ability to walk and is facing months of intense therapy at the
rehab center.

Tests were done and after 13 days in the hospitals, the conclusion is “She was
Vaccine Injured and has received medical exemption status to all future
vaccines”.

Doctors are not hiding this but also are not speaking out.

Pray for my little girl.
