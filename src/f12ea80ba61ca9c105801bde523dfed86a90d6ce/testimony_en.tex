Hi everyone. My husband got his second AstraZeneca jab and 6 days later he’s in
hospital with blood clots in his leg.

Apparently, the vaccine lowered his platelets which caused his blood to
clots. He’s slowly recovering but he can’t put pressure on his foot yet. He’s
been given blood thinners so hopefully he will recover.

I’m so angry!

My husband was healthy with no underlying issues. I wonder how many have
actually been affected and how much is been hidden from us.
