Hannah’s Story in her Own Words:

I Took The Covid Vaccine at 9am August 10th for a sense of peace for my family!!
But woke up AM on August 11th and I got up and couldn’t feel from My Waist
Down!!!!

11th August: I could not move my Legs, had Nausea, Body Aches, Headache, Pain In
My Lower Back and Hips!!! I was taken to Redmond Regional Medical Center,
Cedartown, Georgia.

12th August: Still here At Redmond. Still Basically Paralyzed From The Waist
Down and It So Scary to be this way!!! I am Not Trying To Scare Anyone But Less
Than 24 Hours Since I Took The Covid Vaccine I Have No Movement in My Legs and
Have To Have Help Stand Up On My Own \& Walk Cause My Legs Are Like Jello!! They
are Going To Start Doing All Kind of Test This AM.

14th August: Well Redmond treated me Horrid, so we made the choice to transfer
to “Tanner Medical Center” I am Not Trying To Scare Anyone But I Was Perfectly
Fine Before The Covid Vaccine on Tuesday Morning, and Now I Have No Feeling and
Can’t Move From My Waist Down!! So Please Y’all Beware Of This Vaccine, We Are
Not 110\% Sure It’s From The Vaccine, But I Was Fine Before I Had The Shot and
Now, I am Basically Paralyzed, I Have No Reflexes or Any Movement From Waist
Down!! I Never Been As Scared As I Am Right Now!!

15th August 7:30pm: I Still Can’t Feel From My Waist Down and Still In Tons Of
Pain in My Lower Back!! A lot of Tingling and Numbness!! Neurologist has been in
and going to run more test and more MRIs of my whole spine \& neck!! Also check
Inflammatory Markers in My Blood Work! Leading Towards That The Covid Vaccine-
Moderna Has Attacked The Weakest Part of My Body Which Is My Lower Back \& Legs,
Due To Me Having Ankylosing Spondylitis!!

As of This Morning I am Getting Some Feeling Back From My Knees Down and I’ve
Walked To The Bathroom 3 Times With Assistance and a Walker! Still Very Numb and
Tingling from My Hips To My Feet, But I am Just Praising God That Slowly But
Surely, I am Getting The Feeling Back and I am Going To Be Back To Walking
Again, Maybe Have To Have Assistance From A Walker But I Am Pushing Myself To
Keep Pushing Forward and Walk On My Own! To Say I am Scared Is An
Understatement, But I am Keeping My Faith In God and Knowing He Will See Me
Through It All!!

Today’s Plans Are To Do A Full MRI of My Spine/Back and Also My Neck To See
Where The Pressure and Pain Is Coming From and Making Me So Uncomfortable!! And
Also Get My Pain and Discomfort Under Control Per My Neurologist!

Let Others Be Aware Of The Unknown Side effects of This Horrible Covid Shot!!!

Please note: The first Hospital “Redmond Regional MC” where Hannah got moved
from as she was treated so badly, are presently advertising on their FB Page for
Pregnant Women to get vaccinated!!!
