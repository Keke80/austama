Angela telling her Husbands story:

Julian’s paralysis occurred 12 days after his vaccination. Julian is currently
paralysed from the waist down.

On July 25th, Julian started feeling a tingling and numbness in his left
foot. This quickly progressed up his left leg and then started on his right foot
and travelled up his right leg. Within two hours, Julian could not walk or
stand. He was rushed to Penticton Regional Hospital.

The Neurologist in Penticton became concerned that Julian had developed a
myelinic form of Post-Vaccinal Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

This condition is characterised by a brief but widespread attack of inflammation
in the brain and spinal cord that damages myelin, the protective covering of
nerve fibres.

Julian has swelling on his spine at the T7 – T8 area of his back which is
producing the paralysis.

With two rounds of steroids and IVIG therapy, some swelling has gone down and
we’re hoping and praying that over time, Julian will regain full mobility. To
date, Julian’s mobility has not returned.

We are hoping to bring Julian home October 22. That date marks almost 12 weeks
in hospital.

On behalf of Julian, Emma, Thea and me, we would like to extend a very big
heartfelt thank you for all the love and support during this very difficult
time.
