Jummai lost both of her legs and hands after receiving her second Pfizer
COVID-19 Vaccine.

She was a medical assistant and received her second Pfizer Shot on February 1st
2021. Jummai immediately experienced chest pains.

The pain persisted until February 6th when her husband took her to the emergency
room. She was discharged but hospitalized again on February 13th.

That’s when doctors told Mr. Nache that his wife could die at any moment after
blood clots were found over her entire body.

Both her legs below the knees and most of her hands were surgically removed.

Jummai’s case was investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). The agency could not determine whether the vaccine played a role in her
condition, however, the Nigerian couple are not satisfied with the CDC’s
findings and still have obvious questions. “My experience on this journey has
been so difficult, but I can’t imagine the excruciating pain, mentally,
physically and emotionally that my wife is going through,” Philip Nache said.

The couple both firmly believe that Jummai’s horrifying injuries were a result
of the COVID-19 Vaccines as there is no other plausible explanation.
