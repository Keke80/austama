John’s story in his own words:

I was injected with the 2nd jab of AstraZeneca Vaccine on 24th of April
2021. Was fine, when compared with the side effects from the 1st vaccine,
however, shortly afterwards I suffered a bad heart attack which was caused by
three separate Blood Clots in my heart artery.

I’m lucky to be alive, I’m told, and recently got out of hospital. However I
don’t understand the whole situation, with no answers, but firmly believe it was
caused by the vaccine.
