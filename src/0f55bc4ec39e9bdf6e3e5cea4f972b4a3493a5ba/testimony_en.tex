Anna, only 26 years old, started experiencing adverse reactions right after
receiving her first jab of the AstraZeneca Vaccine. She was told that it was
safe in pregnancy, but sadly she lost her son at 16 weeksâ€™ gestation due to
blood clots in the umbilical cord, confirmed by the Hospital.

She was mandated to get the vaccine for her job and was due to get Pfizer
although was given AstraZeneca instead. They knew she was pregnant when giving
the vaccine and was told it was safe, although when it was too late and after
losing her baby, she was told she should not have been given the AstraZeneca
Vaccine.

Anna is telling her story in this heart-breaking video.
