Age 54 Years, Gianluca got his AstraZeneca Vaccine on May 29th 2021. He felt a
little pain and was tired following the shot. He later suffered a severe
headache and ‘heaviness’ in his legs. He collapsed and was rushed to hospital.

An emergency operation to attempt to remove the blood clots that had spread over
his entire body didn’t succeed.

He passed away on Thursday June 10th 2021.

Sonia his sister says “We were only able to donate his liver and kidneys because
all his organs were full of blood clots. We don’t want anything. We just want
answers. We want to understand how we got to this point. We await these
answers.”

“My father was healthy. Nobody can explain why it ended like this,” says his
daughter Giulia
