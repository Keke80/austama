When I got my 2nd shot, I had a day where I would be fine. Then the next day flu
like symptoms. Another day I would be fine and then in a day or two, flu like
symptoms again. Like others, my arm had a severe reaction to the 2nd shot. The
shot arm stayed swollen red and hot for about three weeks. I called the Health
Dept. and they told me I had Covid-Arm and that it was normal. About two months
after getting the shot, I got dizzy, lightheaded, brain fog and trouble with my
balance. I went to my family doctor and he sent me for an Ultra Sound on the
arteries in my neck and a CT Scan of my brain. Both came back normal.

I went to my ENT and he checked my ears and said they were fine, but that it was
in my spine or my brain. I went to the Orthopaedic Doc and had me get a MRI of
my neck. I just had Cervical Fusion (for the 2nd time). He said those symptoms
were not from my spine.

Whilst in the hospital, my heart rate went too low. I am now wearing a 30-day
heart monitor and I have to have an Ultra Sound of my heart and a Stress Test. I
went to my Neurologist. I have to have an EEG on my brain, go to Physical
Therapy for my balance and an EEG on my legs after the Physical Therapy. Does
this come from the Covid Vaccine? Will my doctors say that is what is causing
all of this? Time will tell when I get through with the Neurologist. I do not
know if they can even fix this. Will I be like this the rest of my life? I truly
believe all my symptoms came from the Moderna Vaccine.
