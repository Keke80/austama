Matthew has been in hospital for eight weeks since 2nd September 2021 – only
four days after his AstraZeneca Vaccination on 31st August 2021.

He has no sensation in his right leg above the knee and can’t move his right leg
at all. He had almost no strength in his right arm, but thankfully that has come
back. He is also suffering from migraines which he never experienced before the
vaccine.

Matt was a healthy 31-year-old and previously in good health.

Matt is an agriculture teacher and has a farm in Mount Whitestone.
