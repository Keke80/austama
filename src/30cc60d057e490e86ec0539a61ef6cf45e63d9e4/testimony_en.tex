Tony’s Story Told by a his Friend Jeffrey Platt:


Tony was laid off from his job at Hoag Hospital right after the pandemic started and he spent the last 16 months looking for work.

Around 3-4 weeks ago Tony finally received employment but his only requirement was a mandated vaccination. He was left choice-less, so Tony agreed to get the vaccine – something he hadn’t wanted to do since the vaccinations started as he wasn’t convinced that it was safe yet. Tony accepted the job, received his first vaccination 3 weeks ago and all was well.


Then after receiving his 2nd dose Tony passed away. The paramedics and 9 other emergency personnel tried desperately for 35 mins trying to revive Tony without success. Prior to Tony’s death, all he could keep saying is, I’m not ready, I’m not ready.


Tony got to see his oldest daughter Trinity graduate a couple months ago, something he and his youngest daughter Taytum will never have the opportunity to celebrate together.


He was a giant of a man, with a gigantic heart and smile one could never forget. The last thing Tony wanted, was to die. He and his wife Tracy had just discussed how everything would get better now and their future with hard work would be restored, that all ended on August 7th, 2021.


Tony was also an Ex-Marine serving in campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tony served his country and selfless in his commitment to the United States Marine Corps.


I know the challenges before all of us, being forced to take a vaccine by the pressures of life, and then dying because of that decision isn’t the way any of us want to leave our family. More so for Tony because he couldn’t have been anymore selfless in his decision and he paid the ultimate price.

His entire family will now share in that price, it couldn’t have gone any worse than it did.}
