Aged 19 Years Old, Shandrille’s Story in Her Own Words:

My name is Shandrille and I’m 19 years old.

I was vaccinated on the 22nd June with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and
a week later I had headaches that didn’t stop.

On 2nd July I went to the ER and after scans the doctor told me I had Brain
Thrombophlebitis (rare form of stroke) and I was hospitalised for 10 days.

The day after I got out of hospital I started having eye problems , so I went to
the ER again on 14th July, and after several exams the doctor told me I was
having a stroke complication. The ophthalmologist explained that I had too much
pressure in my skull which led to a papillary oedema and a ``temporary stop'' of
a left eye optical nerve.

On 22nd July, the neurologist gave me a lumbar puncture to reduce this
pressure. I remain on tablets to lower the pressure and I am also on
anticoagulants.

As a result of the puncture, my vision has improved but has not yet been fully
recovered. I still have many scheduled exams, and still have several months
until I hope I get back to 100\%.

All my clotting problem research tests are negative. So the only plausible
explanation remains the Vaccine Immunisation!
