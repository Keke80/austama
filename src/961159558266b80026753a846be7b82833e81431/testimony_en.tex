Adriana’s Story in Her Own Words:

I am 32 years old and a single mother of a 12 year old son. I recently had a
terrible incident that left me fighting for my life after receiving my first
dose of the Pfizer Vaccine at work.

I had to undergo major test and procedures and be intubated and brought back to
life, spending some time in a coma then in ICU. Since, I’ve been released and
recovering home getting physical therapy and occupational therapy.

I had to learn how to walk again, talk again, write again and just learn
everything all over again. I also lost my memory for a while have been regaining
those memories daily.

Unfortunately the medical reaction to the Pfizer vaccine has left me with some
hefty medical bills. Although I had insurance coverage, for some reason the
insurance will not cover a substantial amount of the expenses. My medical bills
are outstanding and are now over 160K and rising. I keep on calling and
appealing, but I keep getting denied. I do in fact have insurance GHI to be
exact that I get from my job at NYC department of corrections so I’m having a
hard to figuring out why everything is being denied left and right.
