Ronald Biglione, a 32 year old soccer player with Deportivo Club Independencia
in Argentina’s General Levalle League, died a week after being diagnosed with
blood clots.

Media outlets initially reported that he was suffering from a “rare disease” at
the time of his death.

Later it was revealed that the cause of his death was actually ITP (thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura) resulting from his second dose of a COVID-19
vaccine. ITP is a blood disorder in which blood clots form in small blood
vessels throughout the body.

For two weeks, he underwent advanced treatment at the Italian Hospital in
Córdoba, Argentina but without any improvement.

The news came at the same time as the diagnosis of the Argentine football star
Sergio Aguero with Cardiac Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), after he
experienced heart problems during his home debut for FC Barcelona against
Alaves.
