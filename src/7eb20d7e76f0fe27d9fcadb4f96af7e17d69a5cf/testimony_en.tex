Shelley explains all in her video.

I have brushed with death more than a couple times in the last month.

The pericarditis, DVT and the embolisms were a result of the Pfizer Vaccine.

I had the vaccine and two days later I was hospitalized. YOU do the science.

I have been told my video discourages some from getting the vaccine – this is not my intent, BUT knowledge is power. We want this vaccine to have the best efficacy. We want this vaccine to have the least side effects. If those of us who have had negative side effects don’t come forward, this won’t happen.

We need to collect the data on those that are having side effects and find the common denominator here. There are reasons why many are waiting on this vaccine, and this is why I am with the many who don’t agree with the mandate.

I am sharing my experience for the better of mankind. For the better of our fight against a pandemic.

I’m going to keep on keeping on! I’m going to stay positive, so you do the same.
