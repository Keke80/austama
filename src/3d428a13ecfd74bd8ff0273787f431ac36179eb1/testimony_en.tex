Alex was a healthy high school junior who never had any medical issues, but two
days after getting his second dose of the Pfizer Vaccine he had trouble
breathing.

“It was the middle of the night. I was walking upstairs from the basement when I
got a sudden constricting feeling in my chest” Alex said.

His parents immediately rushed him to the hospital. “That’s when things became
eye-opening for us, because it became much more serious very, very fast!” said
Karen, his mother.

Doctors discovered that Alex Franks had Myocarditis – inflammation around his
heart.

According to the Franks’, the doctors wouldn’t say his condition was directly
related to the Pfizer Vaccine, but they are obviously very suspicious of it.
