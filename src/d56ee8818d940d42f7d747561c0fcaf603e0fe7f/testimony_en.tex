I am no longer able to work as a nurse. I feel depressed and hopeless. I feel
like my body has been ‘hijacked’ by something. I feel betrayed. I feel
abandoned.

Four days after second dose of Pfizer Vaccine, I started to have heart
palpitations and a ‘winded’ feeling in chest. It was like I was having panic
attacks for no reason. I also had sudden insomnia. I felt like I had no shut off
switch. I was hyper alert even though my body was physically tired. I could not
sleep for days.

Then two weeks later came on the numbness and tingling in arms and hands, and
then feet and legs. Headaches and tingling sensation from head down to
spine. Internal vibrations and ‘jolting’ feeling when I’m trying to fall asleep,
which wakes me up and scares the F out of me. Also, brain fog and
light-headed/dizzy. Mild tinnitus in both ears. And I feel confused and
slow. Hot showers make all these symptoms worse for some reason.

The panic attacks continue. All symptoms continue. I haven’t been able to work
because I keep having the attacks at work, and I’m a nurse, so that’s a no go!
