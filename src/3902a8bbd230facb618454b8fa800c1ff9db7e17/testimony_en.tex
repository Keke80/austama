Hadley passed away June 15th 2021, not long after her second Covid Vaccine
Jab. Family and friends shared their grievances on social media and would like
Hadley’s story told.

Hadley’s Mother Colleen Writes: “Hadley was a fit and active 20 year old. She
was enrolled in a pre-med program at Wayne State University in Michigan. She had
a bright future, and her life was taken too soon

It’s difficult to sum up Hadley’s beauty, quick-wittedness, and wonderful
personality into just a few sentences. Everyone knew when Hadley walked into a
room. Anyone who met her experienced her electricity and was drawn to it. She
lived a full lifetime in her 20 years. Hadley was a social butterfly, making
friends from every walk of life all around the world. She would talk to anyone
and everyone, anywhere, at any time. She was magnetic.

We were blessed to learn many valuable lessons from Hadley: how to fight
injustice, how to be loyal, how to laugh, and most of all, how to have
fun. Hadley is now in a wonderful place where she will be socialising, dancing,
and making new friends. Laughter, love, and fun guaranteed. She was deeply loved
and will be missed by many.

Fly high butterfly.”
