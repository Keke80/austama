Student Jacob only 14 years old took his second dose of Pfizer on 13th June and
died 3 days later form a cardiac arrest on June 16th, 2021.

He complained of common post-vaccine symptoms, in the two days between his
immunization and death, which included fatigue and fever.

On the night of June 15th, he had a bit of a stomach-ache too, but it wasnâ€™t
severe enough to cause serious concern.

Jacob went to sleep that night, and never woke up. He passed away in the middle
of the night at home.

He was healthy with no pre-existing conditions nor medications.
