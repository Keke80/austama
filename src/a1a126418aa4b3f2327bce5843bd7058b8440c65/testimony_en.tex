Hannah, a young Health Care Worker in the United Kingdom, received the Vaccine
for her job.

She said “I began to feel unwell, my temperature went up and up, and A \& E
suspected Covid. I had a Cardiac Device, ECG, Blood Tests and a CT Scan – The
results came back as ‘Inflammation of my Heart'”.

“More people should be aware of this condition, Myocarditis, a vaccine induced
illness unspoken of, which nearly killed me!”.

Hannah has had many visits to the hospital since being diagnosed with
Myocarditis.
