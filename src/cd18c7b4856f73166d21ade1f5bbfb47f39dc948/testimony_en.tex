I am a type one diabetic, but I got my first shot of the Pfizer Vaccine on
October 1st 2021. Up to this point I have been healthy and everything was good.

On October 17th I got really sick, chills, fever, and vomiting,

On October 18th, I went into emergency and was diagnosed with E.coli Bacterial
Infection, and Kidney Infection (no idea where anything of that came from), so I
was admitted to the hospital.

Being there, in so much pain and nothing working, I was given another pain med
that apparently I am allergic to and it left me almost dying, laying there numb
with 5 nurses standing over me, not being able to move, or talk for an
hour. After I came through, I was then diagnosed with Pneumonia and I developed
Stuttering…. not to mention that the hospital pumped me with 7 litres of fluid,
so my whole body swelled from head to toe.

Fast forward to two and a half weeks later, and 4 different antibiotics, of
which none seem to be working…I’m still in a lot of pain with Pneumonia, and the
Stuttering.

I have asked for more tests but everything they have tested for comes back
normal except infection within my kidneys and believe I still have E.coli
Bacterial Infection. The stuttering hasn’t got any better either. I have tried
to tell them that I believe it is the Pfizer Shot, as I was perfectly healthy
before that, except they are not doing anything for me!

Almost three weeks and I am still in bad pain and a migraine that won’t go away,
and can’t talk properly.
