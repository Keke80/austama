After receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine she immediately had negative
side effects. She had swelling, loss of feeling, not being able to breathe, and
bells palsy.

Now, months later after hospitalisation and rehabs, she still cannot return to
work due to uncontrollable body tremors and bells palsy on the right side of her
face.

Alicia is a hairdresser that felt pressured by some of her clients and the media
to get the Covid-19 vaccine to make them feel safe.

She is a wife and a mother of two young girls.
