Kamrynn died of a Pulmonary Embolism 11 days after the Pfizer Vaccine.

She suffered from hemodynamic collapse (or circulatory collapse) at her home on
March 28th. That means she lost consciousness because blood pressure dropped so
low that the circulatory system wasnâ€™t delivering adequate oxygen to her cells.

Doctors placed her on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine
because her heart and lungs ceased functioning properly. They also found
bilateral pulmonary embolisms (blood clots), meaning both of the main arteries
to her lungs were blocked.

Kamrynn passed away on March 30th.
