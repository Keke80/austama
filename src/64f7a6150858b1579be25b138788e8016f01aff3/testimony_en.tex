Jordan’s Story Told by his Mother, Angela:

Having your son basically tell you that he thinks he’s having a heart attack in
the middle of a church, when he is only 15 years old, is probably one of the
most frightening things that has ever happened to me.

I have definitely questioned my decision as a mother, to have my son take this
vaccine. He will likely be unable to play any sports , or have any physical
activity, for at least two months following this adverse reaction to the Pfizer
Vaccine.

He has been diagnosed with Myocarditis which is a swelling of the heart and his
world has literally been turned upside down.

There is a little that we know and understand about the vaccines, but I was
confident that my healthy young boys would be fine with it.

I thought it would be good to have them vaccinated so that I could check that
box and move on. But, I was wrong!
