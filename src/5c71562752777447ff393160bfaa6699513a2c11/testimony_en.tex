I had my first jab, then a few days later my back got sore and each day it got
worse until I couldn’t stand or walk.

Three months later I’m still the same pain, which is excruciating, never ending,
locked up 70\% of my spine. I can’t work and am highly medicated to get through
my days.

I had an MRI and I will get the results tomorrow, when I see Musculoskeletal
pain specialist (we will update Brent’s story when he has seen the specialist).

I’m a security protection officer and was into gym, martial arts, boxing and
running…. but now I’m housebound!
