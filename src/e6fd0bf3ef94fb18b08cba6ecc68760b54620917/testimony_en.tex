Lia’s Story told by her Friend “Lillie Gordon”:

Unfortunately, my dear friend Lia, one of the most caring humans you will ever
meet, is one of the people who has had long-term, adverse effects from the
Pfizer Vaccine.

Lia got the vaccine in April. Immediately upon receiving it, she experienced
enough numbness, nausea, and shakiness that she was transferred to the ER. The
numbness and tingling continued on and off for several days. She was later
diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) – a rare disorder where (as I
understand it) the body’s immune system attacks its nervous system, but that
diagnosis was inconclusive.

Today (now August 2021), Lia uses a wheelchair to leave the house, cannot bear
weight (even her body weight) for more than a handful of minutes, regularly
experiences burning in her limbs, and has a headache every day. If GBS is
correct, she should hopefully recover in 1-3 years with different treatments.
