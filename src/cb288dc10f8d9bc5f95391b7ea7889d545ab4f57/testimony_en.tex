I went to the hospital on Weds 23rd June 2021 due to shortness of breath, light
headedness, blood pressure higher than normal, bad chest pains, nausea and
tingling in my fingers. I was sent away as they said it was a normal side effect
of the vaccine.

I got blood tests on that Wednesday and all was fine, although I got worse on
Thursday and Friday and was admitted. My blood tests were NOT OK on Friday. I
got an IV and EKG, and ultrasound of my heart, I saw a pulmonologist and
cardiologist, they gave me medicine through my IV and by mouth.

I am told it’s not a permanent thing and it goes away with medicine and rest and
got cleared by the cardiologist doctors from the hospital saying I am fine
now….but I’m not!
