Jennifer, a 37-year-old mother of two with no underlying health conditions,
supported the vaccine programme and would like to get her second dose, but has
received conflicting advice from doctors after experiencing chronic and
debilitating tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and hyperacusis (sensitivity to
sounds) since receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine in early July 2021.

She is concerned that the second dose may make her condition worse. Her GP and
an ear, nose and throat consultant whom she has consulted with have both told
her that this may well happen.

Jennifer says that she had spoken to seven further doctors, consultants and
other medics and all but one either told her that they could not advise her on
whether or not to take the second dose or else have advised her not to.

Her doctors have advised her that the condition may now be permanent.

She has written to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly requesting greater
support for people in her situation.

She said she has received a lack of support from the HSE and has been “left in
limbo”, wanting the second vaccine for her safety and that of her family – and
fearful of having had only one dose – but concerned about the risk of
exacerbating the pitch of her tinnitus if she gets the second jab.

“I am a strong supporter of the vaccination rollout, every day grateful for the
benefits of medical advancement,” she said, but feels she has been “left to play
Russian Roulette” facing the risk of contracting Covid, which she doesn’t
underestimate, and the risk of making her condition worse.
