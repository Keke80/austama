Teenager Jacqueline Aubert is in a Miami hospital after being diagnosed with
Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare but serious autoimmune disorder, as a result of
the Pfizer Vaccine.

Jacqueline’s mother, Michele Aubert, said Jacqueline is currently at the
Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami receiving treatment, and her condition is
improving after experiencing severe back pains and other symptoms related to
GBS.

Jacqueline’s doctors at the Miami hospital connected the rare disorder to the
teenager’s Covid-19 Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine dose, which she received earlier in
the month.

Michele Aubert said she wanted to share what happened to her daughter. “Since
Jacqueline was born premature”, she said “the family sought advice from a
specialist doctor and got approval for the teen to be vaccinated”. She said ``her
daughter received the second dose on 7 Sept 2021''.

“She had the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine in Grand Cayman. Her symptoms began the
next day, on 8 Sept, and a spinal tap on day 7 confirmed the GBS. Her team of
doctors here in Florida has confirmed the vaccine caused the GBS,”
