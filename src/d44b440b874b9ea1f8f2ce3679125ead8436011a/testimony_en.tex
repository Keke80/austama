Imogen, a champion show jumper, developed blood clots on her lungs 14 days after
receiving the Moderna Vaccine.

She experienced shortness of breath a day after the Jab. Over the next few days,
she became so breathless that she was unable to speak. She collapsed on holiday
shortly after, while she was away with her boyfriend. Imogen was hospitalised
and received the news that she had developed ‘two massive blood clots’ on her
lungs.

Imogen spent four days in hospital, only able to see her boyfriend and family
for short periods of time due to COVID-19 restrictions. She now faces the
possibility of surgery for her blood clots and will be on blood-thinning
medication for the rest of her life. Doctors have told Imogen that it could be
three months before her breathing returns to normal.

She represented England in show jumping as a teenager and won a silver medal,
although she may never be able to ride a horse again.

She has reported her health problems to the yellow card scheme, which records
adverse reactions to the COVID-19 Vaccine, and encourages anyone who has
experienced side effects to do the same.
