Cheryl Cohen, a healthy 64-year-old woman from Florida, died three months after
her second dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine.

Gianni Cohen said her mother suddenly developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
— a rare, degenerative and fatal brain disorder, soon after she was vaccinated.

Gianni said her mother received the first dose of Pfizer on April 5th, and her
second dose on April 25th.

On May 6th, Cheryl experienced her first episode indicating “something was
neurologically wrong,” Gianni explained. “She had extreme brain fog and
confusion. She couldn’t remember where she was driving, and got really scared.”

On May 31st, Cheryl called 911 because she was experiencing a severe
headache. She was taken to North Shore Medical Center in Homestead, Florida,
where she was hospitalized for 10 days.

Gianni said: “She got taken to this hospital and I don’t know what they
considered it to be, but they kept her for 10 days and then released her
home. She was in a very very bad state. She said, ‘Hey, I don’t know where I
am”.

“My mother had mass confusion and brain fog. She could not do simple things and
something wasn’t right. We had to have round-the-clock care with friends and
families, thinking this was something that needed to be detoxed from her
system.”

Gianni, who at the time did not know Cheryl had been vaccinated, said her
mother’s condition grew progressively worse.

“She went from being able to work and do normal everyday activities to being
able to do only basic things,” Gianni said. “Before she was vaccinated, she had
her own apartment and worked every day as a sales representative. She cooked,
cleaned and was in a great place in life.”

Around June 19th, Cheryl experienced another severe headache, which became so
bad she felt her head was going to explode, so she went to the emergency room
and was admitted to the hospital, her daughter explained.

“A few days later, I visited her in the hospital and I couldn’t believe my
eyes,” Gianni said. “She couldn’t walk, spoke in broken sentences, wasn’t making
much sense, had uncontrollable body movements, was trembling and unable to be
still.”

The daily regression was rapid. “It was mind-blowing, confusing and truly
heart-breaking. Watching her brain have no control was hard,” Gianni said. “At
first doctors couldn’t find anything medically wrong with Cheryl other than a
slightly elevated white blood cell count. But then MRI imaging of the brain
showed evidence of prion disease, prompting doctors to immediately perform a
lumbar puncture — which ruled out acute infection, tuberculosis, syphilis,
multiple sclerosis and other diseases.”

Prion diseases are a family of rare progressive neurodegenerative disorders that
affect humans and animals. Prion diseases are usually rapidly progressive and
always fatal.

On July 12th, a second lumbar puncture came back positive for CJD — a prion
disease. Cheryl’s tau protein value was 38,979 pg/ml, while the spectrum for CJD
positive patients is 0 – 1,149.

Before she received her diagnosis of CJD. During that time “it was literally
like watching something eat her brain alive,” Gianni said. “While shaking, she
managed to get out the words, ‘This is fucking stupid.’”

“I said, ‘Mom, is this the vaccine?’ and she said, ‘yep.’”

Gianni said she was surprised when she found out her mother had been vaccinated,
as she comes from a family of ‘un-vaxxers’. She believes like many Americans,
her mother felt pressured to get vaccinated because of her job and the media
pressure.

On July 19, Cheryl was discharged to hospice, where she died on July 22nd.

“We didn’t know what to do,” Gianni said. “It’s fatal. There’s no repairing what
was going on. It’s like fast-acting dementia. It was a really sad thing, so
scary, so insane and something [her] doctors hadn’t seen before.”
