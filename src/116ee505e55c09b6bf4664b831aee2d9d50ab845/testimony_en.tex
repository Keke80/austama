French tennis player Jeremy Chardy, suspended his season in September after
suffering a debilitating reaction to a Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. He has suspended
his season without knowing when he will reappear due to an adverse reaction to
the Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine.

“Since I got vaccinated, I have a problem and I am fighting it. Suddenly, I
can’t train, I can’t play. I feel a strong pain throughout my body, even
paralyzing, as soon as I make a physical effort.”

“I have gone to see two doctors, I had some tests done, so I know what I
have. The most important thing is to take care of myself. I even prefer to take
more time to heal and be sure that in the future I will not have any problems
instead of trying to get back into the game as soon as possible and end up with
more health problems. Mentally, it’s difficult because I don’t know how long
it’s going to last. For now, I’m stopping and I don’t know when I’ll be back”,
explained the French tennis player.

He said, “It’s frustrating, I can’t train or play. Now I regret having had the
Pfizer Vaccine, but I couldn’t know.”

“Since I had my vaccine (between the Olympics and the US Open), I have had a
problem and I’ve had a series of struggles. Suddenly, I cannot train and I
cannot play,” said the 34-year-old. The former world number 25 explained that he
felt violent pains all over his body as soon as he made any physical effort.
