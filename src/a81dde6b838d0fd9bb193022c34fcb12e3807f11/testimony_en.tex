Teo telling his story on 05/11/21:

I decided to take this vaccine on the 16th of May 2021 as other family members
did not have any issues.

After the first dose, the Tinnitus occurred, but I did not connect the dots.

So, on the 6th of June 2021 I went for the second vaccination dose.

After that all the symptoms came rapidly:

Brainfog; Palpitations; Insomnia; Fatigue; Pressure in the head; Weight loss;
Dizziness; High blood pressure.

I went to over 10 doctors and only 2 admitted that it might be from the Vaccine,
they did a Brain MRI. I went to the cardiologist 3 times and nothing was found.

I live in a country where the censorship and ignorance is huge.

I regret that I ever took the Pfizer Vaccine because I was a 28-year-old healthy
guy, and now I feel like Iâ€™m 90.

I do hope I will return to what I was before.

I am not an anti-vaxer, never was pro or anti, but please think very hard before
taking this.
