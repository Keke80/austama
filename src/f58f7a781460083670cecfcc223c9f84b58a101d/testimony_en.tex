I had an anaphylactic reaction within the first five minutes of getting the
shot.

My body felt like it was on fire then the itching and hives started. I got
treatment and was ok.

Six months later I threw a blood clot that caused a renal infarct, killing the
left upper quadrant on my left kidney. I have no pre-existing conditions that
would cause this.

I’ve been tested extensively including rare genetic variants and I have none.

My vascular system is completely fine. The only explanation appears to be the
Moderna vaccine.

I’m lucky to be alive. If the clot went to my heart, I might well be dead!
