Natalie suffered from the blood clot to her brain which led to a stroke two
weeks after she received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination.
After collapsing on her kitchen floor on April 16th, she was rushed to Dorset
County Hospital where she spent two weeks before being transferred to Yeatman
Hospital in Sherborne where she stayed for four weeks.
Natalie a mother of three said: ``This has been an awful situation and
completely life-changing. My left arm doesn't work, I'm not able to
drive, I can't dress myself or my kids, I'm still numb in my face
on the left-hand side, I have to use a walking stick in the house and a
mobility scooter because I can't get out the house without it.''
