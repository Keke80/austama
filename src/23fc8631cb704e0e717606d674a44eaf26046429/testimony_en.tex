Madeline’s Story told by her mother, Marah Johnson:

After Pfizer Vaccine (second dose) in March she was sick following the dose for several days, with an extremely high fever. Then all hell started breaking loose bit by bit.

When it began, she had pain in her wrist, numb fingers and palm on her right side. Then it moved to right leg. Then a day later she could barely move her joints and lost most of her strength and small motor skills.

Another day passes and now her left side is showing the same symptoms. This lasted for a few weeks.

Add to that, fevers, nausea, stomach-ache, headaches, swollen knees – her right leg is visibly more swollen than the left with loss of muscle tone.

Many MRI’s and a CT scan have been done, plus a spinal tap later.

They ruled out stroke, and MS. However now she’s tested positive for 11 autoimmune diseases. We are hoping that just because she tested positive for these autoimmune diseases, that she may not actually have all of them. We are still in the process of seeing specialists to fine tune her issues.

Lupus was the strongest positive test. As well as Scleroderma and Sjögrens.

My daughter was a spunky, happy, healthy 21-year-old pre-med college student, but now her world has been turned upside down. She wants to go to med school so bad but if her health doesn’t improve it may not be possible!
