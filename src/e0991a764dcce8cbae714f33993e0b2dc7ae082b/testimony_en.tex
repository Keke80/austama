Emma Writes:

“My had my first Syringe of Pfizer and I had a horrible night, I felt bad, and I threw up violently. I’m now In the emergency room, I have a pulse tachycardia at 150. I really feel like I’m dying but I don’t have the strength to scream!”

Emma subsequently posted this, before Facebook deleted everything…

“There, it’s a disaster… You can’t ride the train anymore, go to the restaurant, nursing homes, hospital, etc, or attend a wedding without having to furnish proof that you are vaccinated. On the train, for example, they put on you a paper bracelet, like in concerts.

Not to mention those who risk dismissal if they are not vaccinated, especially in a hospital setting, caregivers, etc

A total aberration!”
