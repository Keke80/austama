Greg, a life-long cyclist, became unwell during a professional race at the
beginning of September. He was forced to give up the race and was taken to
hospital. It turned out that he had suffered heart damage as a result of his
second Pfizer Vaccine. He is now forced to end his cycling career.
“I was in the chasing group during the Kortemark Race when I suddenly became
unwell,” he says. “I felt a huge pressure in my chest and it was so bad
that I had to leave the race. I was taken to hospital and diagnosed with heart
failure. I already had fever a number of times for no apparent reason after my
second Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, but I had never thought about the relationship.
Further tests have shown that my heart muscle is affected and that my body now
reacts poorly to intensive activity.”
