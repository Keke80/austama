Angela, a Model from Italy has been Hospitalised with Acute Pericarditis from
the Pfizer Vaccine.

She said she suffered pain in her chest, had swollen veins in her arms and legs
and a sore throat shortly after vaccination. That pain became “unbearable” at a
certain point and, with no improvement for two consecutive days, Angela was
rushed to the emergency room. That’s where she was diagnosed with Acute
Pericarditis as a result of the vaccine.

In addition to the excruciating pains in her chest, Angela explained that the
veins in her arms and legs were abnormally swollen and in hospital she underwent
checks and a CT scan that excluded a pulmonary embolism.

Angela spent a total of six nights in hospital, after two initial
hospitalisations, and as of 21st September she is still reporting visits……”again
in the emergency room after the vaccine: I’m going crazy!”.
