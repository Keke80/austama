Leah, a 22-year-old University physical therapy student and body builder was
scared and hesitant to play along with the global “vaccine” agenda, but after
pressure she received her second Pfizer injection and within 10 days she was
hospitalised with Myocarditis.

Leah says “I was diagnosed with Myocarditis as a result of the Pfizer Vaccine. I
was admitted to the ER due to signs of Heart Failure. Testing and Imaging ruled
out any immediate danger of which I am thankful for, but I was referred to a
Cardiologist for further Imaging and Testing”

She said she took “the whole summer off” from exercise because she was diagnosed with Myocarditis after receiving the Pfizer injection, she was working out regularly until July 27th before the Vaccine.
