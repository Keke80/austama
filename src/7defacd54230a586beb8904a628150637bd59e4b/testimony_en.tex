Dave, a former Tae Kwon-Do world champion, had his leg amputated weeks after
receiving the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination.

Dave’s flu-like symptoms started within hours of having the Astra Zeneca
vaccination against Covid-19 on March 4 2021. His symptoms became progressively
worse over the following month.

His foot started to swell and he was rushed to Peterborough Hospital where his
leg was amputated below the knee. The first lower left leg amputation went wrong
and he was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital where he had a second operation
resulting in an above knee amputation.

After a long period of healing followed by a huge change to his day to day
living, Dave is now learning to use his Prosthetic leg and vows to battle back.

Dave is in the process of writing a book called “I’m Still Standing”.
