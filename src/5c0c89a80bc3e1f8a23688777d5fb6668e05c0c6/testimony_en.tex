Linda Supported by her daughter Sarah, Telling Her Story in Her Own Words on
21st August 2021.

After 2 weeks she had severe pain like sciatica in lower back and legs. Most
days she can’t get out of bed until the afternoonn.

Her daughter Sarah tried to persuade her not to get the second Jab but, sadly
the next day day after getting the 2nd one she had a swollen ear and swollen
wrists and all covered in Scabs and Sores. Her pain has doubled.

She’s been prescribed Gabapentin but it’s not touching the pain and her speech
is slurred and she started banging into things.

Linda can hardly walk and now has to use a mobility scooter she was fit healthy
and independent before the vaccine.
