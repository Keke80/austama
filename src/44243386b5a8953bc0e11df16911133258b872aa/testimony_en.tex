I got the Moderna Vaccine with my daughter Nikki. We had the vaccine together
and both had Adverse Reactions.

Three weeks after my vaccine I had seizures and was intubated in the ICU and
almost died.

I am a very healthy 61-year-old female with zero neurological problems prior.

I went into Non Convulsive Status Epilepticus Seizures on September 20th and was
found on the floor by my grandson.

They had to airlift me by REACH to Providence Memorial, in Santa Rosa, the
nearest Trauma Center and I was intubated for 4 days.

I am still on an anti seizure medication, Keppra, and can’t drive. I’m still not
100\% and it’s been two months.

This happened to me because of the Moderna Vaccine.
