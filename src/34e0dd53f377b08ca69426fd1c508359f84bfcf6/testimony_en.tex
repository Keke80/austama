Erin’s Story in Her Own Words:

I’m a speech language pathologist in CT and have had a vaccine reaction for almost 5 months.

I have no pre-existing conditions. I worked out several times a week and even ran 2 miles the day before the vaccine.

I had the Moderna vaccine on 6th January and 12th February. COVID test was negative weekly leading up to vaccine and for 3 weeks after.
About 5 minutes after I had the 1st shot I developed a severe headache that did not resolve with medication.

I later developed severe fatigue and nausea and was unable to work. I was sleeping 12-15 hours a day some days. Over the course of the next 5 weeks, these symptoms came in went in cycles with good days and bad days.

An immunologist told me it was not an allergic reaction and advised me 2nd shot was safe.

The 2nd dose made me significantly worse. I stayed out of work for 3 1/2 months total and only returned because my FML was about to run out.

I have nausea daily and take zofran every morning. There are some days where this is my only symptom. On bad days I can feel like I have the flu and have no idea what triggers it. I get severe whole body fatigue and headache.

I sleep more than half the day. I also have pain in my heart and brain fog. I have difficulty with word finding more than is typical for someone my age and I have a hard time remembering things.

Sometimes I lose my train of thought and mid-sentence I don’t know what I was talking about. I also have tingling and pain in my hands and feet that comes and goes. I’ve had to call out sick once every week since I’ve returned to work due to this illness.

All my bloodwork has been normal with the exception of high inflammation levels. I’ll be seeing an immunologist again to see if I have MCAS as many others have been diagnosed. I’m also going to see a cardiologist and a rheumatologist. I feel as though I have aged 20 years and feel permanently disabled.

Thank you for reading my story.
