Heidi telling her story:

Four months and 22 days later, after my 2nd Moderna Vaccine, I was driving down
the interstate and felt as if someone put an IV with contrast into my left arm
(same arm I received the vaccine). This whole side of my body went numb,
tingling and felt like it was on fire. My chest was tight and I felt awful.

Since this date I continue to experience the following symptoms, all of which
come and go with changes in severity:

Left leg and foot will go numb and tingling; Right leg and foot will go numb and
tingling; I have fallen on two occasions because my leg feels like it is
completely gone; Left wrist and hand will go numb and tingling; Right wrist and
hand will go numb and tingling; Sometimes I cannot type or apply makeup because
my hands wonâ€™t work; Face will go numb and tingling; Sleeping too much or unable
to sleep due to pain; Pain in joints and muscles; Heavy limbs; Increased
headaches/migraines.
