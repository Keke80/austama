Stephanie updating the story of her daughter Maddie, aged just 12, below and in
the new video :

Maddie was in the Pfizer Clinical Trials for 12–15 year-olds conducted through
the Gamble Program at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.

She was a healthy, energetic girl, a good student, kind and social – but they
haven’t seen that version of Maddie since she got the second Pfizer Vaccine.
Within 24 hours she developed abdominal, muscle and nerve pain that became
unbearable and, over the next two-and-a-half months, she was admitted to the
hospital three times, each stay a little longer than the last.

She developed additional symptoms including gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting,
erratic blood pressure and heart rate, memory loss (she mixes up words), brain
fog, headaches, dizziness, fainting (she fell and hit her head) and seizures.

She developed verbal and motor tics, loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle
weakness, drastic changes in her vision, urinary retention and loss of bladder
control, severely irregular heavy menstrual cycles, and eventually she had to
have a NG (feeding) tube put in to get nutrition. All of these symptoms are
still here today, and some days are worse than others.

Steph de Garay, Maddie’s Mother, says “There was nothing wrong with her. She was
perfectly happy and now, whatever happened, it has changed her”.

Nine months post Vaccine they are still living a nightmare with no support from
the medical community.
