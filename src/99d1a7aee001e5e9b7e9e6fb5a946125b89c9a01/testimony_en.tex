The first thing that showed up was Tinnitus and a muffling sensation in the
ears, then heavy brain fog and then issues with hands. I play the Guitar, but I
can’t play at present due to the lack of sensation in my hands.

I now also deal with the following health concerns – Stutter, Speech Issues,
Word Search, Losing Train of Thought and Ongoing Brain Fog.

I am not Anti-Vax. I was so eager to get the vaccination so that I could go and
see my partner in Wellington.

I am just so frustrated that the government won’t help us, or even acknowledge
us, or have any safety-nets, or have any treatments and help when something goes
wrong with the Covid-19 Vaccination. Its just not right!
