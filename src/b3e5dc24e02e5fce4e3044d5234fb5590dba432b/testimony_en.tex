Hi, my name is Rebecca and I am a single mom to wonderful 5-year-old daughter. I
am a federal worker that was mandated to get the COVID vaccine, or lose my
job. As a single mom, that obviously wasnâ€™t an option.

As a result, I experienced what can only be described as a stroke. I lost most
of my vision and am legally blind, along with other visual disturbances that
were not there before.

I also suffer short-term memory loss, brain fog, and cannot put words together
when I talk. The neurological effects mimic a stroke. I was diagnosed with a
traumatic brain injury and will need specialized treatment to help my brain
re-learn some things so I can continue to do my job and to be a capable parent
to my daughter. I am starting vision therapy to bring me back to normal.
