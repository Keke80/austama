Jack Last was inoculated on March 30th and visited his local A\&E eleven days
later complaining of headaches.

His condition worsened and staff at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds
found he had a bleed on the brain. Jack was transferred to Addenbrooke’s
Hospital in Cambridge, where he was heavily sedated before dying on 20th April.

His sister Jasmine, 32, said: “We do believe that his death was linked to the
vaccine. It was very unusual for Jack to feel unwell at all. To my knowledge, he
had never had a day off work due to illness.”
