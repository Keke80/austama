Story told by Everest’s mum Cherie to Bobby Kennedy Jnr:

One day after getting the Pfizer vaccine, Everest became sick. Five days after
being vaccinated, the 17-year-old was hospitalised when doctors discovered two
blood clots in his brain.

Her son, a varsity basketball player at Corner Canyon High School in Draper,
Utah, was a very healthy athletic child who was in the middle of recruiting
season for his school basketball team. Now, the teen can barely walk!

Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, Everest began experiencing an
“exorbitant amount” of pain and swelling in his neck that originated on the same
side he received the vaccine. Cherie took her son to the paediatrician, who
diagnosed the teen with a pulled muscle and placed him in a neck brace.

The doctor was “pretty dismissive,” said Cherie. “We were sent home.”

But within 24 hours of the doctor’s visit, Everest got “one of the worst
migraines he’s ever had.” It lasted nonstop for several days before Cherie took
her son to the emergency room.
