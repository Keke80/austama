My brother was 37. Perfectly healthy until he got his second dose of Moderna
Vaccine on Friday 7th May, and he died on Monday 10th May.

It’s been over a month and a week, and we finally spoke with the medical
examiner that did his autopsy. They said he died of a ruptured brain
aneurysm. He said they are just waiting on the tox screen to come back to make
it official. Here’s my problem with that. I’m not a doctor, but I don’t think
you can die of a brain aneurysm. I know you can have one and it will cause you
to have a stroke, therefore, you’ve died of a stroke.

Here’s my 2¢. I think during the autopsy, they found out my 37-year-old brother
died of a stroke 2 days after his second Vaccine dose. They then were required
to send that information to the CDC and await further instructions on what to do
– that’s why, I think, it took over a month for cause of death! The CDC then
instructed them to notate the cause of the stroke as the cause of death. I think
the Vax gave him a blood clot that produced an aneurysm which ultimately ended
in a stroke.

My whole family lives in Arkansas. My brother had just recently moved to Las
Vegas. After he died and the autopsy was done, my Mom flew out to see him before
the cremation. She told me the nurses she talked to, acted like they knew
exactly what happened, but wouldn’t come out and say it. She said they wouldn’t
make eye contact with her and their answers were generic.
