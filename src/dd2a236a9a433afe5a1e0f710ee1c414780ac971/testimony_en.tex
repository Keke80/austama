Alexa received the 1st of Pfizer on March 19th, 2021. One week later she was
unable to walk without holding onto surrounding objects or stand in one place
for more than 30 seconds without blacking out. She suffered mostly from
debilitating vertigo and intense migraines. I now require the use of assistive
devices such as a walker, cane, and rollator.

Additionally, she now experiences joint pain, muscle atrophy/freezing/weakness,
extreme parathesia on the left side of her body (injection side), nerve pain and
electrical “shocks”, trouble swallowing, menstrual cycle changes, ear ringing,
extreme light and sound sensitivity, lack of depth perception, memory loss,
decreased cognitive ability, and intense sensitivity to foods. She now has
limited mobility.

Her medical team believes these symptoms are caused from systemic inflammation
linked to the Vaccine. Shewas admitted to the hospital for a few days and while
many things like GBS, MS, and autoimmune disorders were ruled out. She is still
seeking answers.
