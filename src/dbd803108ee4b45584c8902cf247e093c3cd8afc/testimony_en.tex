Severe Adverse Reaction: Myocarditis (Inflammation of the Heart). His troponin levels off the charts, at 9,000 (Normal is 40)

He was required to get the vaccine in order to attend school and play soccer, developed a heart condition soon after getting the Pfizer vaccine.

At first he thought his son had pulled a muscle playing sports. But when the symptoms persisted, he took him to a walk-in clinic. Doctors gave the teen an EKG, and found nothing wrong, but recommended he see a cardiologist the next day. The cardiologist did a sonogram, which again turned up nothing, then ran some bloodwork.

Berlingieri said they were told it would be two or three days before they got results from the bloodwork. When they did, it was “bad news.”

“They called and said ‘your son has to get to the emergency room today,’” Berlingieri said. “I said today’s his prom, can he go later? They said, ‘no, he has to go now.’”

After being in the hospital for several days, the high school senior “barely made his graduation,”

The teen is still dealing with scar tissue.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have confirmed hundreds of cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, which is heart inflammation, have been reported in people under 30 after receiving the COVID-19 vaccinations.
