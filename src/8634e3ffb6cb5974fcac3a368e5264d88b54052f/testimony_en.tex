Darlene received the Johnson \& Johnson on March 30 and 2 days later suffered
bleeding in her brain caused by a ruptured aneurysm.

Whilst out shopping with her mother on April 1st she felt sick and went to the
bathroom when they got home. She was in the bathroom for an unusually long
amount of time and her mother called for her through the door, but got no
response she was found unresponsive on the floor.

She was immediately rushed to a local hospital and a CT scan showed severe
bleeding in her brain caused by a ruptured aneurysm. Doctors originally thought
it may have been two ruptured aneurysms due to the amount of blood spilled on
her brain.

She stayed alive for a few days on a life support machine, but she sadly died on
April 9th.
