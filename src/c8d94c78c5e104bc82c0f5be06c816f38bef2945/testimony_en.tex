On July 15, 2021 whilst at work Michelle experienced an adverse reaction to her
Single Shot Vaccine she received two weeks earlier.

The reaction left Michelle being carried into emergency by her boyfriend “Will”
due to having so much weakness in her arms and legs and unable to walk. Michelle
taken to ICU where she still remains.

After many tests they discovered she had a brain bleed and clots in her leg. She
has since had brain surgery to remove the clot and excessive blood and leg
surgery where they removed over 19 clots from her right leg.

Michelle has had treatments to relieve the pressure in her leg and was intubated
for four days, a drain placed in her skull, along with many of procedures. She
is still receiving platelets and fibrinogen a week later to replace all the
blood she lost to the blood clots.

Michelle cannot comprehend what has happened and has suffered short term memory
issue along with many other limitations. Her neurosurgeon has said that once she
is released from the hospital which could be maybe another two weeks, that
recovery could be anywhere from 6 months to a year with a lot of therapy.
