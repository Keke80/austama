I'm a Division 1 student athlete with no prior health issues. 2019-20 OVC
Academic Medal of Honor (4.0 GPA) 2019-20 OVC Commissioner's Honor Roll (3.25+
GPA) I got the second Vaccine and within four days I have been diagnosed with
Myocarditis. I was told I probably won't be able to play my senior season now.

It is a side effect from the Vaccine and it's really not being reported or
addressed. It's a serious issue that we should all be informed about before
making this decision.

No one knows the long-term effects about what is going to possibly happen from
this. It's uncharted territory because everyone else with the same heart issues
from the Vaccine are all being tracked and monitored, we're basically test
subjects.

A lot of people in our age group apparently are at higher risk for heart issues
from the Vaccine and it really needs to be talked about.
