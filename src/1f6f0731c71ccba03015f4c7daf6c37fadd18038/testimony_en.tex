Weverton Silva, just 13 years old, received his Pfizer Vaccine on August 25th
2021 and suffered multiple symptoms shortly afterwards. He collapsed and died on
October 8th 2021 inside a clinic in the urban area of Vale do Anari. His sudden
death was a result of a cardiac arrest and is now under investigation.

The shocking video shows doctors and bystanders trying to resuscitate him for
several minutes, but he didn’t respond.

His mother, Fernanda Graziela, says her son was vaccinated 44 days before he
died. She says “Pray for us and the whole world.”

She has done a Tribute Video to her young son at the end of this clip.
