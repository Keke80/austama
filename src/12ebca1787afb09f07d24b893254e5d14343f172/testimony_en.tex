Ellie, a trainee nurse from Queensland developed blood clots no more than two
weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca jab.

She is left shocked after it took multiple trips to the hospital and her local
GP before anyone even listened.

Ellie was always convinced she was having an adverse reaction to the COVID-19
AstraZeneca Vaccine.

She went to hospital three times and visited her GP twice before it was
discovered she had blood clots in her lungs. Only after continued persistent
requests for further testing, did they finally find three blood clots in one
lung.

It took a further five days to confirm the blood clots were linked to the
AstraZeneca Vaccine.
