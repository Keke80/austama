I worked in a full-time job within healthcare which was very physically
demanding. I worked hard every day and was active, a hiker, traveller, social,
happy, vibrant.

Soon after the Pfizer Vaccine I started to begin having blurred vision and heart
palpitations. Two months out, I was hit with debilitating fatigue, malaise, LE
weakness, UE numbness, Paraesthesia, brain fog, insomnia, leading to a leave of
absence from work for three weeks. Before I returned, I got better but I never
returned to baseline as I was still having tingling in my arms quite often and
suffered blurred vision.

Then in August, all of my symptoms came back plus more – vibrations, jolting in
sleep, dizzy/feeling like you’re on a moving boat, weight loss, muscle loss,
muscle tension, bones hurt, burning, eye issues, ear issues... the list goes on
and on.

I had to resign from my physically demanding job doing occupational
therapy. I’ve been seeing an integrative doctor who has me on a lot of
supplements and also antivirals.
