Maddie's Telling Her Story in April 2021:

About 10 minutes after I received my first Pfizer vaccine, I went into
anaphylactic shock. I struggled to breathe and they gave me a dose of
epinephrine. I immediately started having seizures. The medical staff at the
Kroger Field vaccine site at University Kentucky called EMS; I was transported
to University Kentucky hospital and had a bad experience at their emergency room
to say the least. They helped load me into my Mom’s car after refusing to
transfer me by ambulance, and my Mom drove me while seizuring all the way to
Baptist Health Louisville, where I spent several long days in the ICU.

These next three months will be hard not being allowed to drive, or be alone,
but I am glad I will have my family sticking with me through it.

Whilst this reaction to the vaccine can’t be clinically proven, there has been
other cases where the same thing which happened to me has also happened to
them. I honestly never thought this would happen but I thank God for being with
me through it all.
