Bea’s Story Told by Her Father Jorge:

We had doubts about vaccination of our daughter, but we trust
Directorate-General of Health of Portugal (DGS) and did the first dose on Sunday
18th August.

On 17th August at 10 pm we were in the paediatrician ER, still not knowing why
Bea, combat sports athlete with no health issues, has swollen feet and ankles,
fever and arms pains.

I’m losing my mind; it’s been a lot of awake hours and I’m starting to believe
it wasn’t the best option accept the vaccine.

After 20 hours of exams, tests, echo, tac, and others tests, the Diagonostic
was, a reaction to the vaccine due to an antibiotic that Bea was on!

We are praying everything will be OK and Bea is on Rest at Home within days. Bea
has to see a specialty consultant.
