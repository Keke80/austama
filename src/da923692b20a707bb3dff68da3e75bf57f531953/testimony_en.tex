Paul Zisper, a Munich based Basketball Pro, required emergency surgery following
a Brain Haemorrhage related to the Johnson \& Johnson Vaccine.

Dr. Sebastian Torka and the Diagnostics Munich Medical Team were quick in their
action. Their reports state that due to Paul’s symptoms of dizziness and
headaches, they made the link between the J \& J Vaccination and a possible blood
clot. Saying the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine (a vector vaccine with the same
mechanism of action as the AstraZeneca Vaccine) was suspected as the cause to
their diagnosis of Induced Cerebral Vein Thrombosis. As a result therefore, the
FCBB doctors urged a quick CT scan, and this diagnosis was confirmed .

The experienced Munich Brain Surgeons carried out a 4-hour brain operation.

Through rehab exercises and a lot of training, the winger will soon try to
optimize his coordination again. His sporting future will only become apparent
in the next three – six months.
