Aged 35, the Vaccine stopped all of Kellai’s medications from working.

Kellai says “They told me I might get sick from the vaccine for a couple of days and then I’d be fine. I didn’t get sick, I felt fine afterwards. And then a week and a half later my medication stopped working, and fifty-seven days later I look like this” (in video).

Before the Vaccine Kellai had some underlying health issues, such as depression of which she was on Lithium and fibromyalgia, which she has been addressing with medication, her medical team, and the help of a personal trainer.

Every doctor she talked to told her that taking the C-19 Vaccine was her best chance for living a long life (with her underlying medical issues). But nobody told her that this could happen, or that her medications could stop working; medications that also keep her alive.
