GBS started with being very tired. Then knees and ankles were buckling. Then I
became paralyzed from feet to hips, then hands, all in about one week. Then into
the ER and they told me I had a stroke.

Iâ€™m in a wheelchair and my independence has gone. I have to depend on others for
everything. Pain is constant and everything is a struggle.
