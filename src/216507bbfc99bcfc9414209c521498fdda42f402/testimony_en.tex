Vladimir, a student, has died just six hours after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19
Vaccine.

He received his shot on September 13th at around 14:30. He suffered convulsions
at 20:15 and passed away 20 minutes later.

The 19-year-old who was a student at the Ukrainian Humanitarian Institute,
secretly vaccinated himself without the approval of his family.

“He didn’t tell anyone in his family about his decision to get
vaccinated. Perhaps he knew that everyone would be against it,” says his brother
Ruslan. “He was fearless by nature. He could make spontaneous decisions at any
moment.

Vladimir was playing table tennis shortly after he was vaccinated. In the
evening, his condition worsened. He began to have convulsions out of
nowhere. Doctors and ambulances were called. Resuscitation carried on for about
an hour, but it wasn’t enough to save him “We lost out father seven years ago in
an accident. So our mother raised us all alone. She brought us up as best as she
could,” Ruslan continues. “Vladimir was very cheerful, sympathetic and loved
helping people. He helped poor families. He was also a blood donor. He donated
blood for those in need literally three days before his death.”

A preliminary investigation concluded that Vladimir died from Heart Failure:

This was reported by the Ukrainian Humanitarian Institute.
