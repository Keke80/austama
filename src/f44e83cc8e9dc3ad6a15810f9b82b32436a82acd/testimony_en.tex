Danilo died at the age of just 22. He was celebrating the wedding of his cousins
when he suddenly collapsed and died of a cardiac arrest . The ambulance crew
arrived immediately to try to revive him, unfortunately nothing could done.

Danilo had just graduated from the University of Ferrara.

Office which aims to clarify whether there are any connections of the illness
