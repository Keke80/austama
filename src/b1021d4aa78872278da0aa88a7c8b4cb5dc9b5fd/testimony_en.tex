Story told by his Mother Ritianne:

Following the Pfizer Vaccine my son’s arm hurt and was swollen, red and hot, On
Monday my son got up to chest pain, tightness and shortness of breath so we
called the ambulance. They came, did an ECG and told us that they don’t think it
was an emergency, but they told us to take him to our normal GP. We did that and
the doctor made them do bloods and another ECG. Later on that day I received a
phone call from the doctor tell me to take Micheal straight to the Hospital
Emergency.

They put Micheal on a heart monitor and took more bloods, then, after the
results came back, he was diagnosed with Myocarditis!!

Micheal spent two nights in hospital and he was on ten tablets a day. We are now
waiting for a MRI so we can see the full extent of damage.

He is a 17 year old boy that is meant to be living his best life at the
moment. Micheal is not able to do anything to stress his heart. He is allowed to
go for walk’s and then slowly start doing some light exercise after 4-6 weeks.

I wish that others understand that Myocarditis is not a rare side effect of this
Vaccine. It is happening to a lot of young kids and it needs to be know!! It
really needs to stop!!
