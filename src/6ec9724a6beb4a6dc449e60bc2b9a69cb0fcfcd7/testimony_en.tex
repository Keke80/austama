Hi, my name is Vas.

I was a healthy, 31-year-old athlete, successfully attending law school. But
then, on September 6th 2021, my life took a sudden turn.

I suffered a stroke on Labor Day, three days after the second dose of the Pfizer
COVID-19 Vaccine. Doctors said it was a “freak accident.” I had no pre-existing
conditions.

Among other problems, I cannot eat or drink, I use a stomach tube, I have to
walk with a cane, and my vision is doubled.
