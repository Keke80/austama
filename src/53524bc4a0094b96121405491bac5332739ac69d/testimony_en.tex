Inês, a journalism student, received her Pfizer Vaccine on Monday, August 2nd
2021. Early morning on Saturday 7th August she woke feeling “unwell.” Paramedics
were called and attempted to revive her, but it was too late – she died shortly
thereafter of a cardiac arrest.

The Judiciary Police of Braga in Portugal are stating she died because she drank
too much alcohol! She had no heart issues or serious pre-existing conditions
prior to her death, which had already been attributed to cardiac arrest.

Her uncle told the Correio da Manhã that Ms. Mendes practiced classical dance
and was perfectly healthy prior to the injection. He is not allowing this
official narrative to take hold. He said: “It’s revolting for a healthy girl,
who played sports and had a careful diet, to die like that so suddenly. I do not
believe there were any excesses because Inês did not drink alcohol!”.

An autopsy was performed the following Monday, but authorities said it cannot
determine if the injection caused her death after five days.
