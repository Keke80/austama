Aged 34 years, my brother-in-law Matt, had a stroke “Cerebral venous sinus
thrombosis (CVST)” was the cause and confirmed as being related to the JNJ
vaccine.

He is currently in the ICU with definite brain damage and uncertainty about his
recovery.

Matt is only 34 years old and was in perfect health, he loves to cook and is a
renowned chef in New Jersey, he loves fitness and works out all the time. The
fact that this could have happened to a perfectly healthy individual is
horrifying. Even more horrible is that Matt is newly married and just became a
dad last year to 1 year old Benjamin.

Matt is the kindest, most self-less person that I know, a special someone that
has touched so many lives.
