Deni got his AstraZeneca Jab on July 1st 2021 at the Sumbersuko Health Center in
Lumajang. He died 1 day after receiving the Vaccine.

He immediately experienced dizziness and fever. His condition worsened on July
2nd. He was taken to Dr. Haryoto General Hospital where he died shortly after.

Deni’s brother Arif said. “Just before he got the AstraZeneca Vaccine, he called
me jokingly and asked if I had gotten the Vaccine. I said I didn’t want the
Vaccine because I don’t have any disease. My brother also had no disease, prior
to this Jab”

Deni’s sudden death is being investigated by the Lumajang District Health
Office.
