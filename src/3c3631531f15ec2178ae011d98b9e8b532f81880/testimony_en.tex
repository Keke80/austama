Vinessen Magon, who was forced to Vaccinate to travel to Canada, got an
appointment for his first dose on August 18th 2021. Returning home that
afternoon, Vinessen complained of pain in his head. “His headaches were so
severe, that he was grabbing his head and screaming,” says his mother. He went
to a doctor, who found nothing abnormal and prescribed painkillers. He died 3
weeks later in Victoria Hospital in Candos.

He went to SSRN Hospital for the severe headaches. where he suffered a seizure
while hospitalized. He was then transferred to Victoria Hospital, where he was
placed in the intensive care unit. He was in a comatose state and was put on a
respirator. He died on Wednesday morning, September 8th.

Vinessen was opposed to vaccination, but he had to vaccinate in order to travel
to Canada. Coming from a modest family, he wanted to help his family out of
poverty. He wanted to emigrate to Canada in order to work and be able to send
money to his parents. His relatives say that he did not want the vaccine, but he
had to take it in order to travel to Canada.

His brothers, Vellen and Vanessen said, “He was a good person, too young to
die. ”Vanessen is even more heartbroken because he and his twin did everything
together. Their parents want to understand what happened and will do anything to
find out the truth and see justice for their son.
