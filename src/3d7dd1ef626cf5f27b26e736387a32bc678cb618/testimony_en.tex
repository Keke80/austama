Elias, just 15 years old, died 3 days after receiving the Pfizer Vaccine.

He got his jab on September 10th and was found lifeless in his room on Monday,
September 13th. The family is seeking answers for the sudden death of the
healthy boy.

He was transported to Pan Arcadian General Hospital and despite ‘superhuman
efforts’ of doctors to bring him back to life, they didn’t succeed.

His brother, 31-year-old Nikos said: “My brother was a very strong child, he
never complained about anything. They were talking in his school about getting
the vaccine, so on Friday, he went to get his shot at a Vaccination Center in
Tripoli. He came back home and felt fine in the early stages”, an emotional
Nikos told reporters at the funeral.
