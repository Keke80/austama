Finn’s Mom is sharing his symptoms in the hope that it helps another child and
family:

Finn was an ‘at risk’ child so it was advised that he was vaccinated, and was
one of the first in California within his age group.

40 hours after his 2nd dose of the Pfizer Vaccine he developed chest pain so was
taken to the ER where he was found to have Elevated Troponin and was diagnosed
with Myocarditis. His troponin levels were over 3,400 (Normal is 40) and he
spent 4 days in the hospital.

The cariologist said another 14 year old was admitted for Post-vax Myocarditis
and that his Troponin went above 50,000. I made him repeat it because I couldn’t
believe the number – prayers for that boy.

My son keeps having these brief bouts of mild chest pain/tightness. It could
just be an expected part of recovery, just once a day or so, brief and mild. But
it is stressing him out. I know it can take months for Myocarditis to calm
down. This was happening for a couple weeks after the hospital, then stopped,
but now has started again.
