In his own words:

Aged only 43 years, Shaun had nearly seven feet of intestines removed after
severe blood clots caused by the AstraZeneca Vaccine. He has issued an urgent
warning to other vaccine recipients after being told by doctors he had almost
died.

“I really wish they had let us know what ‘worst case scenario’ might look
like. I had stomach pains and 10 days later they continued for 5 more days. I
spoke to my family doctor twice and then 17 days after my vaccine ended up going
into emergency surgery to remove over 6 feet of my small intestine. I had a
massive blood clot.”

“This is life changing for us I feel like we have a long road ahead of us as far
as recovery goes”

Shaun was vaccinated on April 22nd 2021 and suffered symptoms that progressed
from nausea to headache, vomiting, and fever.

He reported his symptoms, but was advised to stay home multiple times by
doctors. The symptoms progressed to passing and vomiting blood on May 8, and a
day later he was in emergency surgery.

“We are not anti-vaxxers – we just want people to take note of the possible
adverse symptoms following the vaccine – please take it seriously.”
