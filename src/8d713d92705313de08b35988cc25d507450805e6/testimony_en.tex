In Memory of Renee Campbell:

Renee passed away due to complications within the Covid-19 Pandemic situation,
only six days after taking her first Pfizer vaccine shot.

While we are not trying to discourage anyone from getting the vaccination, she
was perfectly healthy prior to taking her first shot.

Renee has always been a cherished member within the healthcare industry in
various capacities. For years, she supervised emergency/Trauma Center’s at both
DC General Hospital and Prince George’s Community Hospital.

Upon her passing she was a valued employee at where she was loved and respected
by her colleagues.

Renee leaves her children Eddie and Allan and six Grand-Children who she adored.
