Sean got his vaccine at the beginning of September and he immediately suffered
multiple health problems. He unexpectedly passed away at home on 27th September
2021 as a result of Myocarditis – Inflammation of the Heart Muscle.

Sean was passionate about sports, especially hockey. He started his hockey
career playing for the Beeton Stingers and went on to play for TNT in Alliston.

People close to Sean staged a small protest close to the hockey arena where the
17-year-old was told that he had to be vaccinated in order to enter the arena.

Sean got the Pfizer Vaccine so that he could play in a hockey arena where the
vaccine is mandated. He was not allowed to play hockey in the arena unless he
took the jab. They said to him ‘you’re not allowed in the arena without the
vaccine’. He got the jab and then two weeks later he died!
