Felicity was hospitalised after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. Shortly after
receiving the 2nd Vaccine, she experienced headaches, blurred vision, tremors
and sensitivity to light. She was hospitalised on 26th August after convulsing.

She has been in and out of hospital ever since.

Felicity Wrote: On the evening of the 24th August my whole body became
paralysed. I was carried to bed and my body began convulsing. The fits continued
into the next day. Paramedics were called out on 26th August. I was taken into
hospital for tests. I was back in hospital on 29th August then referred to
another hospital where I was kept in for tests and observation. Having called
111 several times, I had red flags for neurological symptoms.

20th September: Tomorrow marks 4 weeks since my 2nd and yesterday was the first
full day in 28 days that I didn’t have a seizure.

Yes I am still suffering with a constant headache and body pain, tremors,
convulsions, blurred vision, chest pains, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue,
brain fog, confusion, dizziness, low BP, weakness, paralysis, and eyes that are
so sensitive to light that I have to wear sunglasses in the house; but I am
trying to celebrate the little wins and be as positive as I can be.

Up until this day I have been suffering with up to 12 fits per day and would
often spend half the day semi-conscious and in agonising pain.

Last week on Tuesday my whole body became paralysed and my legs gave in on me.

On Wednesday my whole body was in spasm and the muscles around my heart went
into spasm. I couldn’t breathe and I had shooting pains down my arm.

My family called an ambulance as we thought it was a heart attack and I
genuinely thought that was the end for me.
