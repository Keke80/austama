Alyssa’s Story in Her Own Words:

Eight weeks ago I had my first AstraZeneca Vaccine and I suffered severe
(crippling) headaches for the next 10 days, and then suffered my first (of 5)
Clonic Seizures.

I then suffered a Venous Stroke and was later diagnosed with TTS (as a result of
the AZ VACCINE) and needed to have 3 emergency Craniotomies to release the
pressure in my brain from the bleed.

I was then put into a medically induced coma for 14 days and my poor family had
to make end of life choices many times over.

It terrifies me to think that my 2 girls may have lost their mother as a result
of this vaccine.

I’ve been in hospital for almost 8 weeks now and will most likely require
ongoing rehab for the next 12 months.

I can now walk and talk and feed myself but it’s been a tough road back to this
point.

I’m stunned (and angry) that our leaders continue to say these Vaccines are safe
and should be given to more people. It’s dangerous and reckless and they quite
frankly not good enough. I nearly died, and I’m hoping this craziness stops
soon!
