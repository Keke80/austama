Gabe received his second dose of Pfizer Vaccination and the following day began
experiencing severe chest pains, dizziness, high fever, nausea, and vomiting.

After spending 10 hours in the ER he was diagnosed with myocarditis,
inflammation of the heart.

The hospital admitted that this is an adverse reaction they’re beginning to see
among young males who have received the vaccine.

He’s being treated with various medications and has been sent home for
observation.
