Every day since the Pfizer Vaccine on April 25 2021, I have experienced adverse
effects such as pleurisy, tinnitus, chills, leg tingling, brain fog,
de-realization, nerve pain, vertigo, and now visual issues. It has been the
scariest time in my life and there’s people suffering worse than me. It is
inhumane that we are not being heard.

I have been worried about even putting this out there, but being silent doesn’t
help either.

If you got the Covid Vaccine and are fine, you are very lucky! However, there’s
many people like me, and others, who are suffering so much for months and months
and we need to be heard so we can get help!

I believe everyone should make informed decisions about their own bodies – on
April 15 2021 I decided to get the Pfizer Covid Vaccine.

Just because they say it is super safe, doesn’t mean it will be for
everyone. I’m so tired of suffering in silence. Thank you to anyone who took
time to read this.
