On May 25th,2021 Freddy suffered an immediate and severe reaction to his Moderna
Covid-19 Vaccination. Within the 15-minute waiting period the left side of his
body was paralysed, he went cold, and his breathing became extremely shallow. He
had swelling in his feet and a rash throughout his body. Freddy was treated
immediately on site by paramedics.

The following night he experienced dizziness and heart palpitations, collapsed
in his home and stopped breathing. Freddy's heart went into major atrial
fibrillation and he was transported back to the hospital where a loop recorder
was implanted into his chest to monitor his heart.

Since then he has had six seizures and/or strokes (to be determined),
experiences constant uncontrollable spasms and tremors, migraines, tinnitus,
fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, and overall body pain.

Freddy was taken by ambulance to the hospital after he stopped breathing,
experienced massive tremors in his leg and was unable to move. At the hospital
he was given an ECG and blood work was conducted. When the results came back
clear, they sent him home even after he asked to have further testing completed.

He is unable to work or drive and has difficulty walking. Since his injury he
has been unable to receive proper medical care in his hometown and has been
dismissed and ignored by various health care providers.
