Clint’s Story Told By His Wife Kari:

My husband Clint had a sudden onset illness after receiving the Pfizer Vaccine.

On June 12th, Clint received his 2nd Pfizer Covid vaccine; by June 16th he was experiencing disorientation and confusion.

On June 22nd, he was in full blown psychosis including extreme disorientation and confusion. After 2 hospital stays totalling 17 days, 3 ER visits and a multitude of tests, his medical team stated he had “Early Onset Dementia” brought on by a severe case of West Nile Virus 7 years ago. However, with a new neurology team and re-evaluation, we were informed these symptoms were caused by the Covid Vaccine and that they had seen several of these cases. They also said, “Symptoms may improve but the damage is done.”

Clint is unable to return to work due to the disability caused by the Vaccine. He has not worked at the job he loved and kept for 17+ years in the oil field.
