Michelle from the UK was one of the first under 40’s to be contacted and offered
the AstraZeneca Vaccine due to her breast cancer diagnosis 10 years prior.

At the time she was working in a school and accepted the shot to protect those
around her.

After the vaccine she developed swelling and weakness in her legs, arms, back
and her mobility worsened to the point where her work essentially made her
leave.

Fast forward to now, she can’t leave the house and cannot walk unaided.

In excess of 5 ambulance hospital trips with pain and rheumatology appointments,
nobody wants to acknowledge that the AstraZeneca Vaccine had a part to play in
what they are now diagnosing as M.E!

After eight months she still has had no word from her GP, who said he would be
looking at getting her on the urgent list to be seen by a neurologist!

Michelle explains further in her video.
