Severe Adverse Reaction: , Reported 26th August 2021

Francesca Marcon, a 38-year-old Italian Volleyball player developed Pericarditis
after her second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine.

Francesca immediately suffered from shortness of breath and chest pains after
the Pfizer Vaccine. She went to the emergency room the next day where doctors
diagnosed her with pericarditis.

“Perhaps this speech of mine may be a bit blasphemous, but I ask: is there no
form of compensation for those who suffer health damage after getting the
vaccine? I state that I am not anti-vax, but I have never been convinced of the
making of this vaccine, and I’ve had this confirmed. I don’t know if you are
interested, but I’ve had, and still have, post-vaccine pericarditis. Who pays
the price for all this?”
