Sandra, 60 years of age, died 13 days after the ‘Jab’ of Vaccine Induced
Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis. She received the single-shot Jansen at a CVS
pharmacy on April 8th, just five days before federal health agencies temporarily
paused the vaccine administration.

Tatum her daughter said she knew from the start what no one seemed to want to
believe: “Rationalizing or explaining this as rare doesn’t help….. She was a
real person. She is not a piece of, just like, fictitious political propaganda,
where they’re saying it doesn’t exist. It’s not true. It does exist. She was a
real person with a real life.”

On Sept 20th, Michigan Medicine Pathologist Dr. Michael Caplan completed the
autopsy report. Sandra Jacobs “appears to have succumbed to a ‘rare but
nevertheless documented’ complication associated with the viral vector vaccine,
cerebral venous sinus thrombosis”, he wrote in the summary. According to Yale
Medicine, the condition is characterized by a blood clot in the venous sinuses,
part of the brain’s blood drainage system. This brought about “hemorrhagic
cerebral infarct,” or stroke, caused by brain bleeding and brain swelling,
Caplan wrote.

The death certificate, just obtained after some difficulty, lists the cause as
“complications of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis” and “recent administration”
of a Covid-19 Vaccine as the contributing condition.
