My mom of 61 years and I, 38 years old, got the vaccine together. After the
first shot I had headaches and nausea for two weeks. After my second shot I had
the really bad ‘hit by a truck’ feeling for 48 hours and headaches every day
since then.

Going on two months, I never had headaches before the vaccine, I’ve taken more
Tylenol during this period than I have in the whole of my previous life. I
haven’t received medical attention because I was hoping the headaches would
stop. They haven’t. I have an appointment with my primary care physician on
November 8th.

Three weeks after my mom got her second dose, she went into Non Convulsive
Status Epilepticcus Seizures. My kids found her on the floor.

She is a very healthy 61-year-old. We did the Moderna Vaccine together because
her biggest fear was getting Covid and being taken to a hospital, being
intubated and being without her family. Her biggest fear came true, but not from
Covid.

She had no prior head trauma or history of neurological problems. She almost
died. The neurologist have agreed it ‘could’ be from the vaccine.

They have seen patients with neurological issues come through the hospital after
the vaccine. We are so thankful she is alive.

Nikki’s mothers story will follow in more detail on the NMS website shortly.
