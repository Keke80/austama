Linda Telling the Story of Her Husband Virgil:

On 23rd April 2021 at about 2:15 Virgil took his 2nd Pfizer shot and about 10 to
12 hours later he fell face down to the floor and had a Seizure. He was rushed
to Baptist Hospital and was in ICU.

He is getting better but not out of the woods yet. I ask that everyone keep praying.

During Thanksgiving 2020 he prepared meals for 9 other families. During the
pandemic last year he would drop off food from the church to people in the
community. I was so afraid for him but he didn’t stop helping people. I have
seen him create beautiful obituary programs for family, friends, and
strangers. Giving many hours of his time and knowledge, expecting nothing in
return but just knowing that the family didn’t have to worry about that part of
the loss process. I have seen him go into a restaurant and, because he liked the
food, ask them if he could create them some new menus or create a website to
help there business grow, and when they ask how much did they owe him, he would
reply “nothing.”

I have seen him Love on so many people. He is the most Beautiful person I have
ever known.
