Steve’s daughter Becky Jeisman Telling her Father’s Story:

Aged 55 years, my dad worked in a meat factory in Victoria. To keep his job, he
was coerced into having the jab. He immediately got unwell and lost his job
anyway

After one week he was completely unable to eat and keep anything down and also
bed ridden.

Two weeks post AstraZeneca Vaccine, he went to the doctor complaining of severe
abdominal pain. They did an Xray and saw free air in his abdominal cavity and
sent him away for a CT on the Monday. He got to book in for a CT in the town
over 4 days later (Friday).

He died on the Saturday.

Fecal peritonitis and bowel perforation is listed as the cause of death but the
tear was caused by rupture caused by clots initiated by the Vaccine.

Dad was 55 when he passed. Weighed only 41kg when he died due to not being able
to keep anything down for two weeks prior – post Vaccine.  Final coroner’s
report would not state Vaccine link as it was not definitive.

Died three weeks after the jab.
