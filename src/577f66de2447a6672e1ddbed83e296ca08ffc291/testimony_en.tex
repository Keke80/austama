On 11th March she wrote on her Facebook page how ill she was, and in her own
words it stated “The Vaccine is killing me today” Facebook deleted the post!

Desiree loved teaching children and worked for Killingly Memorial School in
Danielson, CT, USA. She also worked for Stop \& Shop in Dayville, CT.

She was a graduate of Johnson State College in Vermont. She enjoyed playing
rugby.

RIP Desiree.
