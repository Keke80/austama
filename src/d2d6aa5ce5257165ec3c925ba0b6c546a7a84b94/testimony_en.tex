Angie’s story told by her Daughter:

My mother felt the need for a jab because three years ago she had bronchial
pneumonia and didn’t want to be in that position again. So end of January 2021
she took the jab. Soon after she suffered many TIA’s.

The phone calls to the doctor fell on deaf ears and three times she was admitted
to hospital just be sent home. Then the beginning of March she suffered a
massive right-hand stroke 8hrs after her second jab. Leaving her lying alone,
cold, scared and fighting to get up, for 10hrs she fought to reach her phone in
the middle of the night.

The stroke limited her speech, feeding, communication and mobility. All the way
through she had recurring infections, lungs and bladder. She became weaker
because they refused to give her food or drink. They feed her through the
nose. I felt powerless because you are only allowed a one hour visit if you’re
lucky.

I asked for many things to make her life more comfortable and pain free. I asked
many questions but all to no avail. I tried to be calm and diplomatic (I wanted
to know she was being treated kindly when I wasn’t there), but eventually she
died suffocating in her own mucus bronchial tubes closed lungs filled up. No
treatment was given, no oxygen, no antibiotics, no nebuliser…. nothing!

She was alone and scared. They lied to me saying she was just a bit poorly. They
had taken every ounce if dignity from her. I looked at my dead mother and they
said she’s not dead but she had gone! I was holding her hand and wrist, there
was no pulse and she was wax work white. For ten minutes I had to suffer the
indignity of the nurses acting out some bizarre ritual of taking her pulse
before they would agree with me.
