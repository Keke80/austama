Bryan’s story told by his brother, Gary Forster:

My brother Bryan is 55. He had his first stroke at 47, and another two
thereafter, the last at 51. Three years ago, he fell and hit his head and had a
bleed on the brain, resulting in him being taken into a care home. He was
initially mobile, although they moved him to another care home where they
neglected him to a point where he became wheelchair bound. Eventually they
discovered he had a rare condition where the arteries in his brain were
shrinking. But through neglect he had no treatment at all.

In February 2021, I found out they given him his first AstraZeneca Vaccine
WITHOUT CONSENT. I was really upset, due to his medical history, and what I knew
from reading about the side effects of the Vaccine, I thought he was at high
risk of blood clots due to his condition.

Low and behold he had 2 heart attacks. He flatlined, but they resuscitated him
and rushed him to hospital. They operated and removed a large blood clot from
one of his main arteries. The first question the surgeon asked was, which Covid
Vaccine did he have. The surgeon said the clot has damaged a large part of his
heart and he won’t recover and will need special care.

Tell me how can they vaccinate someone with the medical history of my brother,
with a poison that causes blood clots? I’m so angry… this is medical genocide
and it’s really eating me up inside! How could they do this?
