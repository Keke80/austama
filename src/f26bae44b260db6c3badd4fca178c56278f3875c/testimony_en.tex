Footnote from NMS:

In a bizarre twist of fate, Parkerâ€™s mother Leigh-Ann who is only 43, also had a
reaction to her Pfizer vaccine and made a couple of trips to the hospital
herself. Leigh-Ann had a DVT that broke off into a pulmonary embolism in her
right lung. She also ended up with a massive soft tissue infection. Her D-Dimer
was 101,630 instead of 0-500.
