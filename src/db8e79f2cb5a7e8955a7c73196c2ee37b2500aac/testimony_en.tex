Aged just 23 years, Brandon experienced side effects three days after receiving
his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. He says what started as a sore throat and
body aches became worse throughout the day

“I knew something wasn’t right when I started getting really bad chest pain,” he
said.

Lavoie is a 23-year-old who works a physical job as a millwright, and considers
himself a fit and active person. When his chest started to hurt, he went to the
hospital.

“They had me in a bed within 10 minutes,” Something was obviously very wrong
when two doctors and four nurses walked into the room at once.”

He was diagnosed with myocarditis. His doctor said .“She believes that it’s the
Vaccine that caused it,”
