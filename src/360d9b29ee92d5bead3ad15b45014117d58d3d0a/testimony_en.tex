Daughter Katie Telling Her Mums Story:

My mum died on the 21st of February 2021 at just 43 years old just under a month
after she had the first dose of the AstraZeneca jab.

They suspect something was on her lungs.

Since having the vaccine, my mum suffered many of strange effects, firstly it
was constant headaches, not eating much, then she was having cold sensations in
her hand, feet and nose, the doctors assumed it was Raynaud’s disease which she
was being investigated for. Her mental health also seemed a lot worse, she was
having trouble sleeping too.

Five days before she died she was having really bad chest pains, I told her to
go hospital but she rang her GP instead, they gave her an ECG then said
everything is fine and not to go too hospital

One of my mums friends who went round every day found mum unconscious. He rushed
over to the neighbour who then performed CPR for 20mins before the ambulance got
there and they carried on for a further hour but they couldn’t revive her. I
held mum’s hand as they stopped.

I strongly believe it was the vaccine, as my mum was fit and healthy, had no
health conditions.

She was absolutely petrified of getting the jab in the first place but did it
for the sake of the people she looked after.

I feel so angry because the doctors didn’t do anything! She put trust into the
doctors and professionals and look where it’s got us.

I’m 22 years old, I’ve had to take on my two younger brothers as we have no dad
and lost the only person we pretty much have.

I Honestly just thought it was me going through this and didn’t realise so many
others had lost their loved ones to the Vaccines.

Donna Leaves her 3 children Katie 22, Kieran 15, and Aaron 10. Katie has a young
baby, 9 months old and now has the responsibility at the age of 22, of not only
grieving herself, but supporting her brothers through this devastating time.  }
