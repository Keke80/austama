David Turner is warning about the risks of Myocarditis in Teens after his son’s
Adverse Reaction:

My son has been in the ICU for myocarditis, chest pain, and elevated troponin
for past three days following the second dose of Pfizer Vaccine .

Doctors say they’ve seen 60 other boys with the same conditions.

Who’s paying for the ~100K bill and possible heart damage from this experimental
vaccine?

Watch your teens closely and have insurance!
