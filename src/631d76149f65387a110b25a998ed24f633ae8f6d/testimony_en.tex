Jaide telling her story:

I am a victim of an adverse reaction to the AstraZeneca Vaccine, dose 1, and
have been hospitalised 3 times now.

1st time: I was discharged with the diagnosis of “it’s just the side effects of
the vaccine” “muscular pain in your chest” sent home with no follow up’s, just
Panadol/Neurofen tabs.

I got more scans done elsewhere, referred by my GP, and ended up having two
blood clots on my lungs. I was mistreated, dismissed, misdiagnosed and looked
upon that it was just a bi-product of the Vaccine.

2nd time: Readmitted and treated for blood clots, put on blood thinners for the
next 12 months.

3rd time: went back in, still struggling with my breathing and chest pain. Sent
home and told can’t do anything more for me.

I had side effects of constant shaking, muscle ache, joint pain, headache,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tenderness, tiredness, hot and cold chills,
severe chest pain and shortness of breath to a point where I passed out before
walking into the hospital.

No one listened to me. I was struggling to breathe since having the jab. They
don’t understand what it feels like struggling to even breathe at the young age
of 21.

I want my story to be heard.
