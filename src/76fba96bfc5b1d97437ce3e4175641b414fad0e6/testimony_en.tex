Luigi Buttazzo, a surgical equipment technician in Rome, at the Tor Vergata
Hospital, was found dead shortly after he had just received the second dose of
the Pfizer vaccine.

He died in his sleep, at the age of 42, struck down by a heart attack. Known as
“Gigi”, he was an operating room instrumental nurse at the Tor Vergara
Polyclinic and general manager of the Villa Adriana football team. At the
forefront and “always ready to help everyone”, he helped save the lives of
patients, literally hanging by a thread. “He loved to give smiles, to play
football. He was a Lecce fan….”, remembered his colleagues. “…we all wanted to
work with him because he was so competent and conveyed serenity”.

He leaves his wife Letizia, also a nurse, and two daughters, Mia and Giorgia, 27
months and 6 years old. On Friday we have the funeral in the church “San
Silvestro Papa”, in via di Villa Adriana, in Tivoli, his city of origin.

“Gigi had no previous pathologies” …says a colleague from the operating room…
“he often went for a run”.
