Catherine had the AstraZeneca Vaccine on 18th March and the next morning on19th
March she suffered a Severe Stoke and a Cerebral Haemorrhage.

She sadly died on 6th April from a Pulmonary Embolism.

She was hospitalised for just over 2 weeks on a stroke ward. She died on April
6th at 5.26pm from a clot in the artery going to her lungs (PE). She had been on
oxygen 6 days before they even scanned her for a clot! The doctor at the
hospital said I quote “ An Unfortunate Victim of the Vaccine “

She was fit and healthy before the vaccine leading a fulfilled life.

Catherine leaves behind her Husband Peter, and was a mother to 3 Daughters and 2
Sons and a grandmother to 9 Grandchildren.
