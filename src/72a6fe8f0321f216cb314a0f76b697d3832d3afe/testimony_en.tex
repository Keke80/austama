Julie Anne Telling Her Story:

In May of 2021 I got the Moderna Vaccine. I was so desperate for the world to go
back to normal that I would have done anything to help that along.

Before the vaccine I was a perfectly healthy 32-year-old woman. I hiked to the
top of steep mountains, rode bikes with my family, walked 20,000 steps a day,
worked a physically demanding full time job, and was a busy Mom of two always
running from place to place for whatever anyone needed.

Just two short weeks after I got the vaccine everything changed. Suddenly I
couldn’t feel my legs and walking was a struggle. I have pain in my legs all the
time despite taking pain medication. I need assistance getting in and out of the
shower, I rely strongly on handrails and other things to grab on to when I lose
my balance and feel myself nearly falling, I am unable to walk around a grocery
store, unable to drive, unable to do the outdoor things that I love, and I can’t
be the Mom or the wife I used to be.

The only explanation they have for these debilitating neurological symptoms is
my receiving the Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine. That one thing that I thought would
make life normal again has actually made it so much worse.

Sometimes I have bad days and sometimes I have worse than bad days. In order to
function, my medication regimen has changed drastically.

When I agreed to get the vaccine I fully expected a sore arm, maybe some flu
like symptoms for a few days. Nobody told me that my life could be turned upside
down.

Everyone is out here pushing the vaccine. The vaccine is being mandated and
shoved down people’s throats to the point where you are a “Disgrace to America”
if you don’t get it.

Well, this is my new reality. It’s like a game of whack-a-mole, with new
symptoms constantly appearing despite my best efforts to get another one under
control.

Could it be worse? Yea. But why isn’t anyone talking about this? Why aren’t
people openly discussing the BIG risks?

I’m not trying to sway anybody one-way-or-another on getting the Covid-19
vaccine, or any other vaccine for that matter. I will however tell people my
story so that they know that this IS a possible adverse effect to the vaccine.

This is my reality and not enough people are talking about it.
