Hannah developed heart problems almost immediately after her Pfizer Vaccination.

Hannah Says “Almost immediately after my vaccine I had pins and needles down my
arm into my hand and fingers, which are still numb today. Cold chills and dizzy
spells were a regular occurrence. Four days ago (one week post jab) my heart
began racing uncontrollably, making it difficult to slow my heart rate down
enough to sleep (my heart is still racing today). Then the chest pains started
and I took myself to hospital.”

She adds, “If you’re feeling any of these symptoms – get checked out to be safe,
because this side effect is rarely talked about, despite my doctors saying they
have been seeing this more frequently of late”
