Died within five days from receiving the Vaccine on April 24th 2021 Ernesto
Ramirez Jr and his Dad

Ernest Ramirez lost his 16-year-old son after he took the Pfizer Vaccine. He
gives a very emotional account of his son’s story in this video.

“My name is Ernest Ramirez, I was a single parent who lost my son a few days
after he received the Pfizer shot.

Ernesto, my son, received the vaccine and, following his death, the only
explanation that was given to me was an enlarged heart.

My son was in good health, and regularly played baseball since he was 7
years-old.

Advertising claimed that the vaccine is safe for adolescents, and this convinced
me to book-in Ernesto Jr. for the jab on April 19th. Five days later he died.

I need to spread my story so that hopefully no one else will go through what I’m
going through.

Ernesto Jr was my world and I feel I need to fight for him and others that are
also suffering

It kills me to come home to an empty house.

We need to yell, we need to fight, we need to do something. His life was worth
much more than what the Government or anybody else thinks,

I love the hell out of my country but I do not trust my Government anymore.”

Ernesto died of an enlarged heart five days after the jab, according to his
autopsy which showed his heart was double the normal size.

The Video has been banned and censored from every Social Media Platform!
