Connorâ€™s Story in his own Words:

I was going to do my part and get the Vaccine to stop the spread and hopefully
have a return to normalcy.

On Wednesday the 28th of April I got my second dose of Pfizer. I had mild Fever
Symptoms for the next two days.

Friday 30th April I went into school. I wanted to come back to school full time
and make a return to my life before Covid, or at least as close I could get
it. I was going to return to Track and Field and be an active student again.

Saturday however changed all of those plans. On Saturday 1st May I woke up with
horrible chest pain and I was rushed to the ER. Turns out I had the effect of a
heart attack caused by Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart.

Now they are telling me that all of my plans for the summer have been put to a
halt. No strenuous activity for 3-6 months!

For a 17 year old kid about to experience his last summer before senior year,
every week is an eternity out there in the sun, but now I will not be able to
fully harnesses its beauty. No poolside job, no bike rides in the beautiful sun,
no swimming by the lake, and no sports with friends.
