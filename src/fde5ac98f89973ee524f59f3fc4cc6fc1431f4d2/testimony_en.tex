I had a heart condition and had spent many years building my health back. I had
been given 6 months to live in 2016 and they implanted a defibrillator. I am a
landscaper and, even though I am in my early 60’s, I was able to work 6-8 hrs a
day doing very labour intensive work. Heavy lifting, raking, shovelling
etc. Plus I walk my dog daily, do short hikes. In general, my heart did not stop
me from doing anything I wanted to do.

The day after the Pfizer Vaccine I started having arrhythmia, was very tired,
weak, dizzy, and generally felt like I was getting the flu. I missed a few days
work. I wasn’t too alarmed at first, I expected to not feel great for a few
days. But I never felt better, in fact I felt worse as time went on.

I called the vaccine hot line and was told it wasn’t from the vaccine.

On July 16th my heart stopped, I was home alone, my defibrillator restarted my
heart and I came to with a broken ankle.

Since then I have had numerous tests and my cardiologist says there is no
medical reason for my heart to have stopped that day. The arrhythmia started the
day after the Pfizer Vaccine.

I want the victims of vaccine side effects to be acknowledged, supported, and
not punished and shunned by society.
