Virginia died of a stroke 48 hours after receiving the Johnson \& Johnson
COVID-19 Vaccine.

Becca Ingle, her daughter said she is devastated after her mother’s sudden
death. She says her mother was in good health, but started feeling very ill
shortly after getting the vaccine.

As a college professor, Virginia worked in person with her students at
Appalachian State University and spent lots of time caring for her two
grandchildren. 63-year-old Virginia Ellington was counting the days until she
could be vaccinated against COVID-19.

“I have texts from her saying how excited she was to get it,” her daughter,
Becca, said.

Ingle said her mother got the Johnson \& Johnson vaccine on the morning of
Monday, March 8th, at the Watauga Health Center in Boone and started feeling
very tired and even asked her husband about possible vaccine side effects. She
went to work the next day but was still feeling unwell, according to her
family. On Wednesday, March 10, she stayed in bed. A little while later, her
husband returned to the bedroom to find her unresponsive. “He tried giving her
CPR, and he called 911 but they said she was gone when they got there,”

The local doctor, who did a preliminary examination, told the family that her
mother died of a stroke. The local medical examiner, a paramedic and a teacher
who signed the death certificate, wrote that the Vaccine was one of the
“significant conditions contributing to her death.”
