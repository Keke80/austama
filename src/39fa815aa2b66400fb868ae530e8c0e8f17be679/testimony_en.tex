Isabelli, a 16-year-old student, died 8 days after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19
Vaccine.

Following Isabelli’s death, Brazil’s Ministry of Health has suspended the
immunisation against COVID-19 of people aged 12 to 17.

Isabelli got her pfizer vaccine on August 25th. She died of heart-related issues
on September 2nd.  Isabella had symptoms such as dizziness, headache, shortness
of breath and drowsiness a day after vaccination. On Sunday, the 29th, her
mother (Cristina) took her to hospital after she complained of tingling in her
body. “The attending physician said that these symptoms could be psychological
due to the vaccine and that she would be discharged. Before leaving the
hospital, Isabelli passed out,” the mother said.

The young student was transferred to a hospital in São Paulo, where it was found
that Isabelli extreme low levels of red blood cells and haemoglobin, and that
transfusion of eight bags of blood was needed. After a seizure, she was taken to
the intensive care unit. She died on September 2nd.

Cristina said Isabelli got the Vaccine because it was a required for going to
Disney, which was her dream. “She was always very dedicated. It was just the two
of us. She was my life, my reason for living,” said Cristina.

Cristina, says “the death certificate shows that her daughter died from three
possible causes: cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)
and severe anaemia”

Based on unwanted reactions to the vaccine for people aged 12 to 17 years, the
Minister of Health, Marcelo Queiroga, in Brazil has suspended the immunization
of this age group and an investigation into her sudden death has started.
