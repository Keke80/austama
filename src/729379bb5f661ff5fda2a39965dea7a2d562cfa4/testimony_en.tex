“My 18-year-old son almost died of Myocarditis after his first dose of
anti-covid vaccine”

Four days after receiving a first dose of Pfizer vaccine, 18-year-old Quentin
Caron went into intensive care at Narbonne Hospital, France. “I had a perfectly
healthy child. A dose of vaccine and a few days later, I have a child who will
have a fragile heart all his life”.

On July 8th Céline thought she was losing her 18-year-old son. After being
vaccinated against Covid with a first dose, Quentin complained of headaches and
chest pain. After four days of continued pain, he was taken to hospital.

To date he has been 8 days in the hospital, including 3 in intensive care.

She warns all parents: vaccinating children is not without risk – she did not
know this and only learned it by paying a high price as a mother, while she ”
trusted ” the medical and political institutions.
