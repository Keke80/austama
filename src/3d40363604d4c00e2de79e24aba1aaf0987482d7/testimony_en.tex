Davide, an anti-crime policeman, died on March 7th, 12 days after the
administration of the AstraZeneca Vaccine.

He felt very ill the day after the Vaccine. His condition worsened until he died
with a thrombosis which would later cause a brain Haemorrhage.

Messina, married to a judge serving in Catania, and The Prosecutorâ€™s Office
immediately looked in to his death. Obtaining his medical records and appointing
a consultant toxicologist to ascertain the causes of death, starting from the
assumption that the Vaccine could have determined the death.
