I had my Pfizer vaccine on the 13th September 2021. Since then I have vomited,
had migraines and lost the grip in my left hand for two days.

After the second day I started to have chest pains/cramps fluttering and
palpitations. I’m still getting them and it gets worse each day.

It feels like something is moving under my ribs on the left side. The pain is
horrific at times.

My doctor stated it’s either Costochondritis or Myocarditis. I now have to
undergo blood tests and an x-ray. I only had the vaccine to keep my job and now
I wish I’d never had it.
