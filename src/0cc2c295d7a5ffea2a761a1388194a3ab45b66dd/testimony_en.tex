I had my second dose of Pfizer Vaccination on the 22nd September 2021.

I was fine, just an ache in my arm, however two days later I had stabbing chest
pains for 5 minutes at night which slowly went away, but then I kept getting
heart palpitations, sudden short chest pain, extreme fatigue and shortness of
breath.

I visited the hospital on the 5th day after the Vaccine and went through 2 blood
test 2 ECG’s and a Chest X-ray. They eventually told me I have inflammation
markers in my blood with the doctor telling me it was an infection and tried to
blame it on me smoking. But I’ve never experienced anything like this in my
life! They gave me doxycycline antibiotics and told me to come back in a week.

I’ve received a letter from the hospital stating that I was diagnosed with chest
infection…… yet they state that my lungs are clear! I have no symptoms of a
chest infection. I can’t believe that he (the doctor) thinks I’m stupid and
don’t know what a chest infection is… this is a joke now!
