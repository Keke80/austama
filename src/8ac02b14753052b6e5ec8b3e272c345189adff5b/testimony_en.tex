Alessia had received the Moderna Vaccine in mid-May. A few days after the
injection, she began to feel unwell with aches, headaches and pain in her
lungs. She never had any similar problems and did not suffer from any health
issues.

She was hospitalised and unfortunately died in Cosenza Hospital on 9th June 2021
from a pulmonary embolism, as a direct result of the Moderna Vaccine.

The Cosenza Hospital immediately activated their reporting protocol and is
collecting all possible information to ultimately refer Alessiaâ€™s case to the
AIFA.
