Tina Telling the Story of her Father:

My dad had his vaccine on the 9th January 2021 and on the 20th January he had a
stroke and was admitted to hospital. Scans found he had a blood clot on his
brain, he lost the use of his right arm and leg and it also affected his
speech. Three weeks later he was talking to my brother on the phone, he began
coughing and had to put the phone down. My brother phoned the ward to ask if
they can check on him, which they did.

The following morning, they called my mum to inform her my dad had tested
positive with Covid. They moved him instantly to a Covid ward. Six days later on
the Friday they moved my dad to a side ward. In the early hours of Tuesday 16th
February, my dad passed away alone. My sister did ask the nurse where he caught
Covid from and she said he had come into close contact with another patient who
had Covid.

I’m angry as my dad was clinically vulnerable and had been isolating at home and
yet he was placed on a ward with other people. So, so wrong and no one will
never be made accountable.

Because of the circumstances my dad was admitted to hospital ( stroke, blood
clot on his brain), then they said he caught Covid off another patient, then a
few days later he passed away. I wrote to my local MP complaining because he was
clinically vulnerable and we feel he wasn’t protected, they said they would look
into his care. We also have asked for his medical records with Mum’s permission
and today she has had a phone call from the hospital. They have declined to give
them because there was no Will, no power of attorney and nothing went to
probate.

Over the last couple of weeks, I have come to the conclusion that my dad didn’t
really have Covid. I know at the beginning of being in hospital he had
pneumonia, due to aspiration, he wasn’t able to chew his food properly after the
stroke. In the end they had to put a feeding tube in.
