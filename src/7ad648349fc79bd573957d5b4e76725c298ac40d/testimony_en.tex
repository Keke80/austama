Abel died just one day after receiving the AstraZeneca Vaccine. He had his 1st
AZ Vaccine on July 31st and was found unresponsive in his room one day later, on
August 1st.

He had no underlying health issues according to his family. His sudden death is
now under investigation.

He suffered a high fever and shortness of breath immediately after being
vaccinated. He went to his room to rest on his bed. His girlfriend tried to call
him to ask how everything is going, but her phone calls weren’t answered. When
they went to his room to look for him, they found he had died.

His father, Police Lieutenant Wasan, said that his son had received the shot at
the Vaccination Center in Thammasat Hospital at around 09.00. “He likes to
exercise and keep healthy,” his father said. “He didn’t have any underlying
health issues.”

His mother said that her son graduated in business computing at Mahasarakham
University in 2019. He then became a programmer for a private company in
Bangkok. He liked to play basketball there during his free time as he was an
athlete in high school.

Autopsy results from Bhumibol Hospital concluded that he had died from acute
heart failure. The family is collecting evidence to submit to the relevant
authorities. The family does not want anyone else to lose a family member in
this way.
