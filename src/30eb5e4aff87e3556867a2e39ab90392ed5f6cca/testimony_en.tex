Will tells his story:

After the first dose of Pfizer, I fainted and didn’t leave my vaccination hub
for about two hours because I was in and out of consciousness. After that day I
experienced some pain in the needle point (nurse put it in on an angle), mild
fever and chills and constantly felt nauseous.

Second dose of Pfizer, didn’t faint this time, felt perfectly fine, until I went
to bed. Had sharp chest pains, uncontrollable shaking, couldn’t sleep and again,
constantly feeling nauseous.

I had to get the jab due to entering year 12 and I want to be able to travel.

Take vaccine at your own risk!
