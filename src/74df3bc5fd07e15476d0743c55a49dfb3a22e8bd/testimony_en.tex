Davide received the first injection of Pfizer mRNA on June 17th. He suffered no
immediate adverse effects. But around July 10, he started experiencing
debilitating headaches and vomiting.

Davide, son of former volleyball player Paolo Bristot, died at the age of
18. The night before he died, the he went to the hospital to be examined after a
severe pain in his head. At the end of a series of exams, however, he was sent
home.

Davide’s parents, Paolo and Barbara Bristot, took him to the Belluno Hospital at
about 10:30 p.m. that evening. Doctors did a few clinical tests and placed an IV
(“drip”) in his arm for an hour before discharging him. They said he was a
healthy, 18-year-old athletic man so nothing more could possibly be
wrong. Davide went to sleep immediately when he got home.

Barbara grew suspicious the next morning when Davide didn’t come out of his room
at all. She opened his door and discovered her son’s lifeless body at the foot
of his bed, Wednesday morning, July 14th.
