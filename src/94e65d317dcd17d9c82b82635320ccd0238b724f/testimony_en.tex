Pascale telling Philippe’s story:

After his second Pfizer injection on September 15th, Philippe, my 7 Year old
son’s Dad, developed Guillain Barré syndrome. He is paralysed except for his
hands, is on a ventilator and a drip. He cannot speak, nor walk, nor open his
eyes and therefore cannot read.

He is only 63 years of age and is now at the Orleans hospital.
