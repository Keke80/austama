Rozanne, aged 50, explains all in her video:

Despite the Severe Adverse Reactions, her GP told her that she MUST get the 2nd
Vaccine and she will probably get sicker, insisting she must have the 2nd shot
for the sake of ‘her’ children who she does not want to get Covid!

At the vaccine centre, on seeing how unwell Rozanne was, they refused to give
her the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine, but despite an exemption being requested, The
Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) have declined the Exemption!
